History of Present Illness:
54 year old female with recent diagnosis of ulcerative colitis
on 6-mercaptopurine, prednisone 40-60 mg daily, who presents
with a new onset of headache and neck stiffness. The patient is
in distress, rigoring and has aphasia and only limited history

later spiked with temp to 104.4 (rectal), HR 91, BP 112/54, RR
24, O2 sat 100 %. Head CT was done and relealved attenuation
within the subcortical white matter of the right medial frontal
lobe. LP was performed showing opening pressure 24 cm H2O WBC of

Radiology:
CXR [**11-16**]: Diffusely increased opacities at the lung fields
bilaterally. In an immunocompromised patient, this is concerning
for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2**]. Radiographically, the differential includes
pulmonary edema. Additionally, there is a faint opacity at the
right lung base, which may represent atelectasis or focal
pneumonic process.
.
CT-Head [**11-16**]: Focus of low attenuation within the subcortical
white matter of the right medial frontal lobe. This may
represent a subacute infarction; however, an underlying mass
lesion cannot be completely excluded. An MRI examination with
gadolinium and diffusion-weighted imaging is recommended for
further evaluation. No intracranial hemorrhage noted.
.
MR-head-w&w/o gadolinium [**11-18**]:
Signal abnormality in the medial right frontal lobe involving
the corpus callosum does not demonstrate enhancement. This
finding most likely represent a small infarct. However, in
absence of ADC map, age of the infarct could not be determined.
No abnormal enhancement is seen. Follow up is suggested, if
clinically indicated.
.
Echo [**11-18**]:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. While difficult to
assess given the limited views suspect Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
If clinically indicated, would recommend a TEE.
.
CXR [**11-21**]:
Resolution of congestive failure with persistent small bilateral
pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis
.
Studies:
EEG [**11-17**]: This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to the presence of
a slow
and disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing -
all
consistent with a mild encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or
anoxic
etiology. No evidence for ongoing seizures is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  54 woman on immunosuppressive therapy for UC (prednisone,
6MP) who presents with new onset HA, fever with bacterial
meningitis and gram positive rod bacteremia.
.
#. Listeriosis - meningitis and bacteremia. Patient presented
with headache, nuchal rigidity, expressive aphasia, afebrile on
admission but temp to 104.4 in the ED, where she also started to
have rigors.  LP showed >300 WBC, poly predominant with 5%
monocytes, protein 152 glucose 16.  CSF gram stain showed gram
positive rods, blood culture grew gram positive rods, speciation
eventually grew listeria. Empiric treatment based on gram stain
was started: ampicillin and bactrim (to cover both nocardia and
question of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] below), vanc and ceftriaxone as well pending
confirmation of gram stain and culture results.  Once
speciations was confirmed, a five day course of gentamicin was
started for synergy, and vancomycin and ceftriaxone d/c'd.
Bactrim was maintained on treatment dose for concern for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 4**] [**11-21**], when it was changed to prophylaxis dose.  Early on
admission, she developed hypotension that required levophed, but
was weaned off of pressors within the first couple of days of
admission with PRBCs (total of 4 units) and volume
resussitation.  Given bacteremia, TTE was done, no vegetations
or lesions noted. Head CT on admission showed right medial
frontal lobe likely infarct versus mass lesion, no hemorrhage.
Subsequent MRI confirmed infarct, unclear date, and EEG
consistent with meningitis.  Neurology was consulted, and the
patient was placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis given
meningoencephalitis. She spiked fevers to 101-102 over the first
several days of admission.  By [**11-19**], her neurological exam was
markedly improved, and by [**11-21**] her headache was gone, no
meningeal signs noted, although her baseline essential tremor
was slightly more severe. Surveillance blood cultures reamined
negative from [**11-17**] on.  Notably, she was transferred from ICU
to floor on [**11-21**], but noninvasive BP was read as 60/d, patient
mentating well, sent back to ICU. In the ICU, an arterial line
was placed, and consistently read 20-30 mmHg higher than
sphyngomanometer.  This discrepancy was of unclear etiology, but
persistent.  Patient maintained normal mentation, good urine
output, no tachycardia, and it was judged that, for some unclear
reason, the cuff pressures underestimated by 20-30 points.  On
[**11-23**], she was sent to the floor for further care and management.
.
#. Bilateral lung opacities/hypoxia. Initial chest film read as
increased opacities bilaterally concerning for PCP (given
steroids and no PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5**]) vs. bacterial pneumonia vs. pulmonary
edema. She had signifcant oxygen requirement, and her
respiratory distress led to her being placed on CPAP+PS.  The
origin of her significant hypoxia was originally thought to be
secondary to likely vascular leak from sepsis/CHF versus PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 6**]
induced sputum was attempted, but was unsuccessful, and was not
repeated initally given her unstable respiratory status, and
susbsequent evaluation that likelihood of PCP was small.  She
responded well to lasix diuresis, with reduced O2 requirements.
.
#. UC: She continued to receive her outpatient dose of
prednisone, which was changed on [**11-22**] to dexamethasone IV; her
outpatient 6-MP was held. After several days with no diarrhea,
it recurred on [**11-22**] soon after her diet had advanced. C.diff was
negative. She was made NPO, and fed via TPN for bowel rest.  On
[**11-24**], it was noted that she began passing BRBRP, her hematocrit
was noted to drop two points and pt was typed and crossed and
consent for blood transfusion.
.
#. Anemia. On admission, she was found to be anemic. She
received PRBCs for anemia on admission and again [**11-19**] for mixed
venous sat <70%.  She was found to have iron binding studies c/w
anemia of chronic disease.  Her HCT was followed closely, and
remained stable for the remainder of her admission.
.
#. FEN: Her diet was advanced as tolerated, but she was made NPO
with TPN on [**11-22**] after she developed diarrhea, thought secondary
to continued UC activity.
.
#. Prophylaxis: PPI. Hold SQ Hep, pneumoboots. Initially on
droplet precautions.
.
#. Code status: FULL
.
#. Communication: patient, her sister, brother, and mother
.
#. Lines: peripheral IV x 2. left subclavian CC.  A-line. Eval
for PICC; once in place, can d/c central line, a-line.

Surgery Discharge part:
Pt underwent total abdominal colectomy with ileoostomy on
[**2147-11-26**].  She was on Clinda/Gent peri-procedure and Amplicillin
for 21 days at first.  She was seen by PT/OT and was NPO until
the ostomy started to function.  SHe had c/o nausea as diet was
tolerated and it was slowed down.  MRI was suspicious for an
abcess and amplicillin was started for at least a total of 6
weeks as per ID.  She was given a PICC.  On [**12-5**] she was
cleared by PT and was in good condition for d/c to rehab on
[**2147-12-5**].
