# Clinical Transformer MRC

## Aim
The package is the implementation of a transformer based MRC (Machine Reading Comprehension) system for clinical information extraction task. We aim to provide a simple and quick tool for researchers to conduct clinical NER and RE without comprehensive knowledge of transformers.
