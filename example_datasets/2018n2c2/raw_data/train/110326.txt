Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45556**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleeding, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p central line placement


History of Present Illness:
68-year-old male with a history of hypertension and gout who is
being treated on the biologics service with IL-2 for metastatic
melanoma.  He began the protocol on Monday and had been
tollerating the TID IL-2 infusions, but had a decline in his
plts from 200 to 56 as well as a 11# weight gain attributed to
capillary leak.  He also had significant electrolyte imbalances,
tachycardia, and tachypnea expected from this protocol.
   On the day of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer, patient had some mild epigastric
discomfort and complained to his daughter of heartburn.  Of
note, he was on daily indocin while on IL-2 therapy.  At 10pm,
he developed some diarrhea and then had an episode of nausea and
vomiting.  The covering MD noted 2 very large blood clotts in
the emesis.  Noted increased RR of 40s, was 84% on RA and then
improved to 100% on 4L NC.  Biologics attending was not
concerned about other parameters, but was worried abt bleeding
as patient may be at risk for bleeding given his plts have
dropped in the past few days.
  Brought to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], GI team asks for FFP, plts.  Pt has guiac
positive brown stools, but complains of hemorrhoids and some
rectal irritation that may be contributing.  Holding on NG
lavage unless patient becomes unstable.  First two hcts are
stable.

Past Medical History:
Onc Hx per OMED notes:
Pt was diagnosed with melanoma in [**4-/2167**] when he was found to
have a mole on his left abdomen.  He underwent wide local
excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy at that time which
revealed no residual melanoma and the 3 sentinel nodes were
negative.  Two years later in [**4-18**], he developed a red raised
nodule under the scar of the local excision.  This was reexcised
and he subsequently did well until [**8-/2169**] when he had another
satellite recurrence and reexcision.  He then had a third
satellite recurrence and reexcision in [**10/2169**] and was then
started on interferon therapy that was stopped [**2-15**] side effects.
Recent PET/CT done revealed a left axillary lymphadenopathy as
well as 2 liver lesions.

Pertinent Results:
CXR PORTABLE [**3-27**]
IMPRESSION: Minimal patchy basilar opacities likely due to
atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
.
[**2170-3-31**] CXR PORTABLE
IMPRESSION: New diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities
compatible with pulmonary edema.
.
[**2170-3-31**]
CHEST XR: A single AP supine view is compared to previous
examination earlier from the same day. Again seen extensive
bilateral parenchymal opacities suggesting pulmonary edema.
There is more dense consolidation in left lower lobe with air
bronchogram, compatible with pneumonia. There is a new
endotracheal tube with the tip overlying T3.
.
[**2170-4-2**]
BILATERAL LE DOPPLER
IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
.
ECHO [**2170-4-2**]: EF>60%
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
3. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
.
[**2170-4-4**] RENAL US
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple left kidney stones, the largest measuring 2.1 cm in
the mid pole. No evidence of hydronephrosis. Multiple parapelvic
cysts.
2. Right kidney stone. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
.
[**2170-4-7**] LIVER/GB ULTRASOUND
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal
dilation. No evidence of cholecystitis. 1.3 cm shadowing
gallstone.
2. Two hypoechoic liver lesions likely corresponding to the
lesions seen on CT. Metastatic disease to the liver is within
the differential.
.
[**2170-4-9**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-2**] and 24:
Left lower lobe consolidation is clearing, probably resolving
atelectasis. Pulmonary vascular congestion is present but edema
has not returned. Azygous distention indicates volume overload.
Heart size is top normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
ET tube and right subclavian line are in standard placements and
a nasogastric tube passes through the mid stomach and out of
view.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer, [**2170-3-29**], patient
had some mild epigastric discomfort and complained to his
daughter of heartburn. Of note, he was on daily indocin while on
IL-2 therapy. At 10pm, he developed some diarrhea and then had
an episode of nausea and vomiting. The covering MD noted 2 very
large blood clots in the emesis. Noted increased RR of 40s, was
84% on RA and then improved to 100% on 4L NC. Biologics
attending was not concerned about other parameters, but was
worried about bleeding as patient may be at risk for bleeding
given his plts have dropped in the past few days.
.
Brought to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], GI team requested FFP, plts. Pt has guiac
positive brown stools, and complained of hemorrhoids and some
rectal irritation that may be contributing. He was not scoped
emergently that night, and his vitals were closely followed,
along with Hct.  His Hct was noted to be stable, with stable VS,
and no episodes of melena.  GI felt no emergent need for EGD.
He is receiving PPI [**Hospital1 **].  On [**4-1**], the pt was intubated for
respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary edema thought to be
secondary to capillary leak syndrome from HD IL-2.  He underwent
diuresis and was started on levo/flagyl for ?LLL PNA, started
[**3-31**].  On [**4-3**], levo/flagyl d/c'd as all cx negative, pt
afebrile.  Another reason abx d/c'd was b/c pt developed a rash
thought to be a drug hypersensitivity reaction, which improved
post d/c abx.  ID was consulted [**4-4**] for continued fevers and
recommended the initiation of broad spectrum abx incl.
Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Flagyl (stopped [**4-8**]), RUQ US to r/o
cholangitis (b/c pt had elev LFTs), and stated would not give
steroids, and would do bronchoscopy/BAL for most likely pulm
source.  Chest CT demonstrated b/l lower lobe infiltrates c/w
pulm edema vs. PNA.  Pt underwent Bronch [**4-5**], showing limited
eval of right sided airways, lavage with RLL post segment,
result: no PMN, no microorg, grew OP flora, PCP negative, AFB
negative.  Vancomycin was continued for ? line infection, and
b/c the pt had difficult access, his line was continued for 19
days.  He has been on Vanco for 8 days. The pt's LFT elevation
was attributed to IL-2 therapy, a known side effect.
.
Also, he was noted to have renal insufficiency, with Cr to 1.6,
and eosinophilia, with presumed AIN.  His creatinine continued
to rise to 2.6 (baseline 0.9).  He was given prednisone, which
was subsequently d/c'd.  Renal was consulted [**2170-4-5**] and
recommended for pt to increase free water intake.  They felt he
had a number of reasons to have ARF, including: capillary leak
syndrome, NSAIDs, infection, contrast on [**4-2**], and drug reaction
though no eos or WBC in urine.  The pt's creatinine demonstrated
slow improvement, was 1.4 [**4-7**], and on transfer from ICU, his Cr
was 0.9 (baseline).
.
Subjectively on transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the medical floor, the pt
felt well, is laughing and joking with family, and has no pain
complaints.  States his breathing if fine.  No cough, fever,
chills.  No N/V.  No abd pain.  No diarrhea or constipation.  No
dysuria.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.

________________________________________________________________
Impression:  A/P: 69 M with metastatic melanoma s/p IL-2
therapy, last dose at 3 pm [**3-29**], now with fevers, resp failure
[**2-15**] non-cardiogenic pulm edema; now improving, extubated [**4-12**],
and satting well on NC.  Resolved ARF.  s/p Drug
hypersensitivity reaction with discontinuation of all
antibiotics and improvement.
.
#. Pulmonary status s/p respiratory distress: Mr. [**Known lastname 64730**] was
intubated initially [**3-31**] for resp distress, thought secondary to
non-cardiogenic pulm edema from capillary leak syndrome from
Il-2, with possible contribution from PNA. LLL inbfiltrate on
CXR, fevers, but sputum never grew anything, so unclear if PNA
vs atalectasis. He was intially started on levaquin and flagyl.
Chest CT showed lower lobe infiltrates c/w pulm edema vs PNA.
Lenis were neg, but he did not have a CTA because of renal
failure. He has no h/o CHF, COPD or asthma. No Echo on file. The
pt was then taken off all abx on [**4-11**] because all cx data was
negative and fevers seemed likely due to acute interstitial
nephritis given eosinophilia, ARF, rash versus due to his
melanoma and IL'2 treatment. ID was consulted, recommended
bronchoscopy and labs, empiric sntibiotics for presumed Hospital
acquired PNA vs. line infection, so he was started on
vancomycin. Bronchoscopy from [**4-5**] was negative. He remained on
vancomycin for 8 days until his central line was pulled.  We
then discontinued Vancomycin IV.
-now on room air, sats stable
-nebs prn if needed
-chest PT, mobilize secretions
-IS to bedside and encourage pt to use
.
# ARF, resolved: this was thought to be acute interstitial
nephritis given fever, rash and ARF with peripheral
eosinophilia. However, eos negative in urine. Renal consulted
felt to be pre-renal also question contrast induced nephropathy.
This fully resolved with hydration, so finally appeared to be
most likely pre-renal and contrast related.  His creatinine
continued to be at his baseline.  We ended up restarting his
outpatient ACEI.  Will see PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week.
.
# Fever: Unclear etiology still, all cultures negative. He has
been hemodynamically stable. ID was consulted in the setting of
contemplating starting steroids.  ID recomended to r/o infection
BAL prior to starting empiric antibiotics, multiples serologies
histoplasma antigen, EBV viral load, CMV viral load, cryptococal
antigen, Strongiloides serology. RUQ u/s. All work up
unrevealing to date, and fevers tapered off. Afebrile for 6 days
prior to leaving ICU. Initial empiric a/b regimen with flagyl,
aztreonam and vanco was D/C'd .  He has remained afebrile on the
medical floor and has been instructed to report to the ED for
fever, chills.
.
#. Hypernatremia, resolved: Likely due to increase insensible
lossess. Free water boluses and D5w was given with normalization
of sodium.
.
#. ?Line infection:  Pt was continuing to spike fevers in the
ICU with a negative panculture workup and no infiltrate.  Other
sources excluded, so IV vamco empirically given.   His line was
pulled, no drainage and erythema at site.  His blood cx are
negative to date.  We stopped IV vancomycin on transfer to
medical floor, no evidence to support its use.
.
#. Metastatic Melanoma:  Il-2 therapy on hold for now. Plan per
Onc team, attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Doctor Last Name **].  His restaging lung
CT, head CT showed only mediastinal nodes largest 1.7 cm, could
not assess for pulm nodules given pulm edema.  The pt has follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
#. GI Bleed:  The pt had emesis with large clots on [**3-28**]. No
further bleeding, hct has since remained stable stable. The pt
can continue his PPI.  His Hct has remained stable, as well as
his vital signs.
.
#. Elevated LFTs: stable.  This is a known side effect of IL-2
therapy.  We held his IL-2, and trended his LFTs, which improved
over time.
.
#  Confusion/ICU psychosis:  Pt had vivid dreams as well as
hallucinations while in the ICU, and would often speak
inappropriately at times or answer questions with responses
unrelated.  He was started on low dose haldol.  On the medical
floor, the pt was appropriate in conversation, but would
occasionally state things that he was going to "[**Country 4194**] to herd
cattle."  On questioning his family, they stated that he has no
plans for a trip.  He is otherwise appropriate.  He has an
appointment to follow up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week. His haldol was
not given while he was on the medical floor.
.
#. Communication: with pt, wife and daughter [**Telephone/Fax (1) 64731**]
.
#. Nutrition:
The pt initially failed his speech and swallow study, however
the study was done a few hours post extubation, when the pt
still had copious secretions.  At the time of transfer to the
medical floor, the pt was swallowing and chewing fine.  He did
not experience any choking or coughing episodes with eating, and
he is tolerating a po diet well.  We did not repeat his swallow
study.  He does not appear to be an aspiration risk now.
.
#. Access: RSC multi-lumen [**3-26**] discontinued, now with pIV
.
#. Code: full
.
#. Proph: PPI, pneumoboots, heparin sq tid
.
#. Dispo: Home with physical therapy services. Follow up with
PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has a CAT scan scheduled for the last week in [**Month (only) 547**],
followed by a Heme/Onc appt on [**5-16**].
