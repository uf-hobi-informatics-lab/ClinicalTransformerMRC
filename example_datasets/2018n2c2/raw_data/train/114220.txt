Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Codeine / Quinidine/Quinine / Norvasc / Pravachol

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
Briefly, Mrs. [**Known lastname 107414**] is a very pleasant [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with  CAD,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p failed cardioversion (most
recent on [**2140-5-5**]), CKD (Stage III) who initially presented [**5-17**]
with 4 weeks of lightheadedness and vertigo and 3 days of SOB.
.
She was seen by her primary cardiologist [**5-16**], at which time her
flecainide was d/c'ed and her metoprolol and diltiazem were
increased for rate control. Apparently she had not been taking
the prescribed doses of BB/CCB and presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
with chest pressure and atrial fibrillation with RVR. Initially
she was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] where she was noted to be in volume
overload and diuresed with furosemide, 40 mg IV. She was also
given metoprolol (at increased dose from 12.5 to 25 then 50 [**Hospital1 **]
over the course of two days) and verapramil (180 mg qd) for rate
control. This morning she complained of chest pain, was noted to
be bradycardic (60s) and hypotensive (SBP in mid 70s). She was
given 1.5 lt of IVF bolus and started on dopamine (uptitrated to
20 mcg). After these interventions her pressure improved to the
100s but then decreased again to the 90s. Her urine output
remained low. She had cardiac enzymes drawn, the first set being
negative, an ECG without ST changes, and a TTE, which showed
global hypokinesis with EF of 25%. Reportedly her EF from a TEE
done in early [**Month (only) **] was near normal (reported as mild depressed
LVEF. Last ECHO before that was in 90s with normal EF. Also has
had a cath in the 90s with normal coronaries, per report.
Notably her INR is also elevated to 3.7, presumably secondary to
warfarin.
.
Several days prior to presentation her VNA found her to be
tachycardic to 120s, and was referred Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] saw her [**5-16**] and
d/ced her fleicanide and increased her metoprolol, which the
patient did not take as she did not pick up prescirption. She
also reports having chest pain/pressure o/n 4d PTA,
non-radiating, no n/v/diaphoresis resolved w/ burping. Patient
was recently admitted with Afib w/ RVR, was cardioverted on [**5-5**]
and discharged home on flecainide, verapamil, metroprolol. She
has had no palpitations, no syncope, no PND or orthopnea. Pt.
also reports persistent RLE edema, since her rehab discharge,
this is unchaged, pt. takes lasix prn for this.
.
In the CCU, the patient admits to feeling cold. She denies,
chest pain, palpitations, fevers, chills, cough, abdominal pain,
or bleeding. There is no difficulty w/ speech. No dysuria, no
abdominal pain, constipation/diarrhea.

CT HEAD ([**5-25**]):
Probable acute/subacute infarct in the left posterior frontal
lobe, though evaluation is limited given the extent of
background chronic
microvascular ischemic disease. Recommended MRI with DWI for
confirmation.

matter within the
left frontal and temporal lobes. No evidence of hemorrhagic
transformation or mass effect.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]yo F with h/o a fib s/p recent 2nd cardioversion on
[**5-5**], HTN, ? CAD s/p clean cath [**2127**], s/p recent femur fx, PNA
and cellulitis who p/w afib w/ RVR, persistent weakness,
lightheadedness, vertigo and DOE.
.
1. Afib w/ RVR. Pt. was admitted with presyncopal symptoms and
vertigo, likely from central hypoperfusion, though cerebellar
dysfunction could not be ruled out given positive romberg in
setting of intact proprioception.  She was HD stable on
admission and her INR was 3.6. Her Afib recurrence was felt to
be exacerbating CHF as evident on last TEE.  Patient was
restarted on Verapamil of 180mg, her BB was increased to 37.5mg
[**Hospital1 **] and her coumadin was held.  On HD#2, patient developed afib
with slow VR, chest pain, diaphoresis and nausea, her ECG was
unchanged and her CE were negative x1.  She subsequently
developed hypotension to mid 70s mmHgs, which did not respond to
IVF and required dopamine for HD stability.  She was temporarily
transferred to CCU where pressors were weaned within few hours
of arrival.  It was felt that her hypotension was secondary to
poor inotropy in setting of bradycardia from multiple nodal
blocking agents.  Throughout stay in CCU she was borderline
tachycardic and was eventually placed back on small dose of
lopressor for HR control. On HD#3 she was transferred to the
floor w/ HR of 100bpm and only on 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] of metoprolol.  She
remained HD stable and converted to atrial tachycardia vs. slow
aflutter.  Her BB was increased and she was started on low dose
digoxin without loading, 0.125 mg EOD.
.
On this regiment her HR was difficult to control.  She continued
to remain in Afib/flutter with HR in 100s despite 50mg TID of
BB, digoxin.  She was started on amiodarone and underwent
cardioversion on [**2140-5-24**].  This was successful, pt. was in sinus
rhythm.  Her BB was decreased to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] due to temporary
bradycardia to high 40s, digoxin was discontinued and amiodarone
decreased to 200mg [**Hospital1 **].  With this regimen, HR maintained in
50s, her DOE improved significantly and her lightheadedness and
dizziness resolved.  On [**5-25**] at ~ 11pm patient was noted be
unable to speak.  Her neurological deficits included R facial
droop and eye lid muscle weakness.  Code stroke was called, CT
head showed a L distal MCA stroke in insular region.  No tPA was
administered due to INR of 2.9. Her INR became supratherapeutic
with INR 3.9 on her day of discharge hence Coumadin is held for
now.  It needs to be restarted at 1mg once daily once INR <3.0
and needs daily monitoring until stable.  Dosing may need to go
up once Amiodarone dosing decreases to daily dosing on [**6-2**].
Also, patient should be started on lisinopril for heart
protection on [**6-2**].
.
2. CAD - Pt. had h/o CAD with no h/o MI, CABG or PCI.  She had a
clean cath in [**2127**]. Based on above PMHx it was not suspected
that she had flow limiting CAD, especially with no elevation of
CEs in setting of cardiogenic shock.  She ruled out for MI.  She
was continued on BB as above.
.
3. Systolic CHF.  Pt. had a nl EF in [**2127**] Echo, but no other
imaging except a TEE, where it was noted that she had mild
systolic dysfunction.  TTE here prior to hypotensive episode
showed global vertricular dysfunction w/ EF of 20-25%  Given
lack of significant CAD, this was felt to be most likely
tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy and treatment was focused on
HR control.  Pt. was volume overloaded on exam, likely
contributed by the tachycardia and poor filling.  She was
continued on home dose of lasix. She was started on ACE-I,
Lisinopril 5mg daily, however due to renal failure, Cr. 1.5 this
was discontinued.  Her lasix was held on [**5-26**].  This should be
restarted within a day as tolerated by volume status, likely
[**5-27**] (home lasix dose of 40mg PO).
.
4. Acute on Chronic RF: Cr on admission up to 1.3 Likely due
decreased CO w/ LV CHF in setting of afib.  Cr recovered to 1.1,
near baseline after complications with hypotension, however
bumpted back up s/p cardioversion in setting of receiving extra
10mg IV lasix.  Cr improved to 1.2 on [**5-26**].  Her lasix is
currently being held.
.
5. Left MCA infarct in the setting of therapeutic INR: Most
likely cardioembolic given the risk factor and patient returned
to Afib rhythm from sinus after cardioversion.  Pt was not a
thrombolytic or endovascular therapy candidate due to high INR
hence high bleeding risk.  Patient was transferred to the
neurology service on [**5-26**] and MRI showed that she has acute
superior division of L MCA infarct (precentral gyrus) but not a
large infarct hence safe for anticoagulation.

Patient remains unable to speak, but can make vocalizations, and
is able to swallow. She has mild R facial droop with weakness,
more in the arm than leg.  Physical and occupational therapy
recommended acute rehab.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response,
atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, cardiogenic shock
Secondary: Left MCA (middle cerebral artery) infarct while INR
therapeutic.


Discharge Condition:
Hemodynamically stable, improved heart rate - mostly
non-verbal/mute with new left MCA stroke with right facial droop
and some right arm weakness (more proximal and distal) but
strong in the lower extremities.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with recurrence of your rapid heart
rate and lightheadedness.  This was felt to be due to your
failed cardioversion.  You were treated with medications to
reduce your heart rate.

Your course was complicated by a rapid slowing of your heart and
very low blood pressures that require temporary stay in an
intensive care unit.  It was also determined that your heart's
pumping action was also poor.  For this reason and your heart
rate control, your medications were readjusted.

You undewent cardioversion on [**5-24**] but afterwards was found to
have right facial droop due to left MCA infarct.  This was while
your INR was therapeutic hence you were not candidate for
thrombolysis or endovascular therapy given high risk of
bleeding.

You were transferred to neurology service on [**5-26**] and evaluated
per physical and occupational therapy who recommend acute rehab
given your new stroke.  Speech therapist also evaluated who
recommended pureed diet with nectar liquid and crushed meds in
puree.

You were restarted on Amiodarone 200mg twice daily on [**5-27**] which
is to be continued for 1 week then starting on [**6-2**], please
switch to 200mg once daily.  Starting [**6-2**], please also start
low dose ACEI (e.g. lisinopril) for your severe CHF.

You will also need a repeat echo i 2~3 months and follow-up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within 4~8 weeks.

You are going to an acute rehabilitation facility for aggressive
physical and occupational therapy plus speech therapy.  You will
also need telemetry to for heart rate monitoring plus daily labs
including INR for Coumadin dosing.  Coumadin dose may need to be
increased once Amiodarone dose decreases plus please continue to
monitor TSH while on Amiodarone.

Should you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness,
lightheadedness, severe weakness, worsening leg swelling,
difficulties with balance, worsening palpitations or any other
symptoms concerning to you, please call your primary care
doctor, your cardiologist or go to the nearest emergency room.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your primary care doctor, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 216**], within 2 weeks of discharge from the acute rehab
facility in [**Location (un) 38**], please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1247**] for an
appointment.

Repeat echo in 2~3 months plus follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] within 4~8 weeks.  Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**] to
reschedule your appt given that the current appointment is too
remote.
