Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12131**]
Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint:  acute SOB

Reason for MICU transfer:  suspected PE, sepsis [**3-8**] UTI


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
63F w/ recurrent stage IIIC papillary serous ovarian CA on cycle
8 day 14 of carboplatin, gemcitabine, bevacizumab (avastin),
complicated by ureter obstruction requiring left ureteral stent
and right nephrostomy tube. She had a week of SOB PTA but on
[**6-16**] had acute onset of SOB when at home, with fever, without
cough, and no abd pain, no dysuria. Oncologic course has been
complicated by b/l hydronephrosis thought to be [**3-8**] malignancy,
as well as utereral obstructions requiring right nephrostomy
tube.

In the ED, initial VS were:  101 108 158/67 24 100% 2L (highest
temp was 102.3). EKG showed ST 106 incomplete RB on previous,
incomplete L bundle.  CTA was deferred due to elevated Cr.
Non-con belly scan was ordered and bedside u/s showed normal
fast, no pericardial effusion, no right heart strain, mild left
hydronephrosis, normal right kidney. She was started on
Vanc/Cefepime and given APAP. Urine from nephrostomy was cloudy;
Foley'd urine was the second drawn. Heparin gtt was commenced
for suspected PE. She had an elevated pro-BNP but normal trop,
and no right axis deviation on ECG or on u/s: was not a
candidate for TPA.

On arrival to the MICU, she does not c/o any pain, but is still
feeling SOB, better when supine as opposed to sitting up.  She
denies CP, HA, abdom pain, pain upon deep inspiration, pain in
calves/thighs. Adds that on day of admission, she felt more SOB
fairly abruptly while sitting outside; at baseline, has no h/o
heart problems or SOB when walking. She still urinates and also
has UOP through the nephrostomy tube; is maintaining PO intake
and says she still made urine at home today.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18573**] is a 63F w/ recurrent stage IIIC papillary
serous ovarian CA on cycle 8 day 14 of carboplatin, gemcitabine,
bevacizumab (avastin), and b/l hydronephrosis [**3-8**] ureter
obstruction requiring left ureteral stent and right nephrostomy
tube. She p/w acute onset SOB in the setting of one week of
dyspnea and fatigue, which was initially concerning for PE.
Further w/u ended up ruling out PE, and her SOB was likely in
the context of her fever and GNR bacteremia, which were likely
[**3-8**] urinary source.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Dyspnea: Pt p/w acute onset SOB, and was found to be in sinus
tach with elevated d-dimer and BNP in setting of malignancy,
although bedside u/s showed no e/o R heart strain. She did not
undergo CTA due to elevated Cr, but was started on a heparin gtt
in the ED. Upon admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she had no Si/Sx of
hemodynamic or respiratory collapse. ACS, PNA or pulmonary edema
were r/o. LENIs were obtained, which were negative. A VQ scan
was subsequently performed, and it was low probability for PE
and the heparin was d/c'd. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] her SOB vastly improved
without further intervention. Her dyspnea was most likely due to
her anemia as she significantly improved after transfusion of 2
units pRBCs for a HCT of 18.
.
# Fevers and UTI: UTI was likely cause for her fevers to 102.3
and diff with 91% PMNs. Pt has a h/o b/l hydronephrosis [**3-8**]
ureter obstruction requiring left ureteral stent and right
nephrostomy tube, and all UA's have been positive with pyuria
and hematuria since [**2-15**]. Upon admission, she again had positive
UA's from both foley and nephrostomy tube. She received
vanc/cefepime in the ED; her past urine Cx's have grown E coli
sensitive to cefepime. Per past urology notes, her R kidney is
not functioning as well as the left, and no other urological
interventions were necessary; she is scheduled for a left stent
change in [**7-17**].
While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], GNRs grew out of her blood Cx from [**6-16**], and
she was continued on cefepime (d1=[**6-16**]), and continued on vanc
(d1=[**6-16**]) given that she has a port. Her urine culture grew coag
+ staph and per Urology, it was recommended to continue treating
the UTI w/o indication for stent removal at this time. Her urine
culture eventually speciated as pansensitive staphylococcus
aureus, and she was transitioned to oral augmentin to compelte a
total 14 day course following discharge.  Her blood cultures
speciated as pansensitive E. coli and she was transitined to
oral ciprofloxacin, also to complete a 14 day course, priro to
dishcarge.  She remained afebrile and stable on oral antibiotics
for 24 hours prior to discharge.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Baseline Cr is about 1.2-1.3; pt initially p/w Cr 1.9.
Likely prerenal etiology given fever and UTI and FeNa of 0.9%.
She has a h/o obstruction, but had been maintaining good UOP
from urethra and nephrostomy. Her Cr improved in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to 1.4
after 2 units pRBCs, and subsequently improved further to 1.2 by
the time of discharge.
.
# Anemia: Macrocytic anemia with Hct 24.9 and MCV 102 on
admission; baseline Hct is in high 20's. She had no Si/Sx of
active bleeding upon admission, although the pt endorses small
amts of blood in stool while on avastin, known to heme-onc. She
had a 6-point Hct drop after admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with no
identified source; her Hct bumped appropriately after 2U PRBC's.
Her stool was guaiac negative.
.
CHRONIC OR INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Most likely [**3-8**] chemo per her primary
oncologist, as per hx of similar s/p chemo and is unlikely HIT
as her platelets were decreased upon admission and before the
initiation of the heparin gtt.
.
# Recurrent stage IIIC papillary serous ovarian CA on cycle 8
day 14 of carboplatin, gemcitabine, bevacizumab (avastin).
.
# HTN: initially held home lisinopril 5mg daily given fevers,
UTI, and [**Last Name (un) **]. Once her creatinine decreased to 1.4, her home
lisinopril was re-started.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18573**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the [**Hospital1 771**].  You were admitted with shortness of
breath and fevers.  You were initially admitted to our intensive
care unit, where you were treated with antibiotics.  Your blood
counts were found to be low, and you were given blood
transfusions. You were initally started on a blood thinner to
treat you for a potential blood clot in your lungs, but
subsequent studies showed that you were unlikely to have
developed a blood clot, and the blood thinner was stopped.  Your
breathing improved after blood transfusion.

We found that you have an infection in your blood and urine.
You were treated initially with intravenous antibiotics, and
eventually switched to oral antibiotics.  You will need to
compelte a course of oral antibiotics as an outpatient.  Please
followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic.

We made the following changes to your medications:
STARTED
-Augmentin until [**2181-7-1**]
-Ciprofloxacin until [**2181-7-1**]
-Senna and Polyethylene glycol to help you move your bowels

Please continue taking your other medications as usual.

Please followup with your doctors, see below.
