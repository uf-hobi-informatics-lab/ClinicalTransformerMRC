[**2153-1-17**]:
CHEST PA AND LATERAL.
Compared to the prior radiograph obtained yesterday, there is
decreased CHF.  There is mild cardiomegaly. There are small
bilateral effusions, more on the left. The new biventricular
pacer device is seen in the left hemithorax. The pacer leads are
seen in the right atrium and two in the floor of the right
ventricle. The previous abandoned right pacer leads are also
seen in the right atrium and right ventricle. No pneumothorax.
Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation.
IMPRESSION:
1. Improving CHF.
2. Small bilateral layering pleural effusions, more on the left.

3. Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation.
4. Good position of the new biventricular pacer device.
.
[**2153-1-17**]:
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.
FINDINGS: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. The
appearance of
the ventricles, cisterns, and sulci is unchanged. There is no
mass effect,
hydrocephalus, or shift of the normally midline structures. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved.
The visualized mastoid air cells are clear. Again noted is sinus
mucosal
thickening bilaterally in the maxillary sinuses, not fully
characterized here.
IMPRESSION:
1. Similar sinus mucosal thickening.
2. No evidence of significant interval change.
3. Similar appearance of the brain including prominent
encephalomalacic
changes in the right occipital lobe, and possibly in the left
occipital lobe as well.
.
[**2153-1-17**]:
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a biventricular
pacemaker in place, not fully characterized here, and evidence
of prior sternotomy. There are large bilateral pleural effusions
with adjacent areas of compressive atelectasis. Otherwise, the
lung bases are clear.
Within the limitations of the non-contrast study, the liver,
gallbladder,
pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are within normal limits. A
7-mm
nonobstructing stone is again visualized in the left kidney, as
well as a 12 mm stone in the left renal pelvis. These are
unchanged. A small new 2- mm nonobstructing stone is now seen in
the right kidney. Left-sided
hydronephrosis has resolved. Within the limitations of the
non-contrast study, the appearance of the kidneys is otherwise
unremarkable.
There is calcification of the abdominal aorta, and of the
splenic artery. The stomach, small and large bowel are
unremarkable. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric
lymphadenopathy, or free air or fluid.
Along the anterior left lateral ribs at the base of the chest,
there is a soft tissue density, not fully characterized here,
which may represent a small hematoma or inflammatory stranding
from recent pacer placement. Its
extent is not delineated here. There is no evidence of a
retroperitoneal
hematoma.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is considerable
amount of stool in the rectum. The prostate, seminal vesicles,
and bladder are within normal limits. There is a 5-mm calcific
density in the distal left ureter, which could represent a
nonobstructing stone. It was not seen previously.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Possible hematoma along the left basal chest wall, in the
subcutaneous
tissues, not fully evaluated here.
3. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
4. Multiple nonobstructing stones in the kidneys bilaterally, as
well as a 6- mm calcific density in the left pelvis, which may
represent a nonobstructing renal stone in the left ureter.
.
[**2153-1-18**]:
TECHNIQUE: Left upper extremity venous ultrasound and Doppler
examination,
and limited evaluation of the subcutaneous tissues of the left
upper
hemithorax.
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left internal
jugular,
axillary, basilic, and paired brachial veins show no evidence of
deep vein
thrombosis. Because of the presence of the overlying pacer, the
left
subclavian vein could not be evaluated. No intraluminal thrombus
is
identified.
In the tissues overlying the pacemaker, there is heterogeneous
appearance,
which may represent postoperative change, but the presence of
hematoma cannot be excluded. No large discrete fluid collection
is identified. Laterally, near the insertion of the pectoralis
major muscle, the appearance suggests either edematous muscle or
complex fluid, but the static images presented are
indeterminant.
IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneous tissue in the region of the pacer, which is
indeterminant in etiology.
2. Suggestion of edematous left pectoral muscle and/or complex
fluid,
suggested by resident review in real time scanning. However on
the static
images, it is difficult to discern the relationship between the
muscle, the adjacent heterogeneous soft tissue, and the pacer.
A followup ultrasound for evaluation and comparison, or
alternatively a CT, which may show an area of hyperdensity to
correspond to an acute hematoma if present, is suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 73yoM with parkinson disease, HTN, DM, systolic HF (EF 20% in
[**11-4**]), history of CVA (residual left visual field cut), AF s/p
AVN ablation and pacer, inmediate s/p BiV pacer upgrade with
slowly recover after sedation transfer to CCU for monitoring.
After the haldol wore off, mental status was felt to return to
baseline.  Of note, hematocrit was noted to drop on the day of
procedure.  CT abd/Pelvis was done and was negative for
retroperitoneal bleed.  Left upper extremity also noted to be
more swollen on [**1-18**] and ultrasound was performed which was
negative for DVT.

# mental status change: Patient likely sensitive to sedation,
requiring , more alert, able to follow simple commands. He is
able to movilize all extremities, still somnolent. more likely
given his baseline disease, he is more sensitive to sedation.
Patient seemed to recover in the 10-12 hours post-sedation.
Head CT was performed and was negative for intracranial bleed.
Neurology was consulted and agreed that mental status changes
likely to haldol being given.
.
1. Parkinson's disease: will continue home medications sinemet,
mirapex and pramipexol.

2. CV:
Rhythm: h/o Afib - heparin bridge to coumadin.  Heparin was
stopped in setting of hematocrit drop and restarted on [**2153-1-19**].
S/P BiV pacer- he was given Vancomycin Iv x 3 doses.
AV paced
Carvedilol continued for rate control
Pace maker checked on [**2153-1-19**].
Pump: EF 17% on MIBI, currently euvolemic. Will continue
Carvediolol and Furosemide home dose and digoxin. We will
recommend to discusse with your primary cardiologist regarding
Ace inhibitor medications
CAD: continue aspirin, statin, Carvedilol

3. Heme: On admission Hct noted to be 37.  This was likely
hemoconcentrated as Hcts from 3 weeks prior were 31-32.
However, given Hct decrease to 25, CT scan of Abd/Pelvis and
including upper thighs done and negative for hematoma or bleed.
He was tranfused 2 units of pRBCs and Hct increased. Hematocrit
should be monitored on an outpatient basis.

4. left upper extremity swelling: noted on [**1-18**].  Concern for
DVT or bleed. Ultrasound of upper extrmity done and negative for
DVT.

5. GERD: Continue Pantoprazole

6. FENA: Cardiac healthy -diabetic diet.

7.  Dispo: to rehab.  Patient should have Hematocrit checked on
[**1-22**] (Hct 27.6 on [**1-19**]).  Left upper extremity swelling seems to
be resolving.  His left arm may be elevated to decrease
swelling, but is not to be elevated above shoulder level given
new biVentricular pacemaker placement.
