T-spine CT ([**11-1**]):
1.  Large mass involving the posterior elements at the level of
T9 on the left which is invading the central canal and causing
thecal sac compression.
2.  Multiple masses in the lung consistent with metastases.
Findings were discussed with you the day of the study.

L-spine CT ([**11-1**]):
1.  Congenitally narrowed central spinal canal as described
above.  Mild degenerative changes at L4-5 with a diffuse
broad-based disc bulge.  There is no evidence for neural
foraminal narrowing.
2.  No bony lesions are identified to indicate metastatic isease
in the lumbar spine.  Please see thoracic spine report of the
same date for significant findings regarding likely metastatic
disease.

Chest CT ([**11-1**]):
1.  Numerous bilateral soft tissue density pulmonary nodules
consistentwith pulmonary metastases. Given the history of prior
nephrectomy, metastatic renal cell carcinoma is likely.
2.  Destructive osseous lesion in the T9 vertebral body with
encroachment upon the spinal canal.  Urgent Neurosurgery consult
and further characterization with dedicated MRI is required.
3.  Coronary artery calcifications.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Medicine service for initial work up. CT
guided biospy was performed on [**2112-11-3**], pathology result was
renal cell carcinoma and the T9 lesion was considered
metastasis.
Right after receiving this result, patient was scheduled for (1)
tumor embolization by interventional radiology and (2)t7-11
laminectomies/mass resection and fusion on [**2112-11-8**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 548**].
Post operatively he was moving all extremities with full
strength he had a drain placed interoperatively.
On POD#2 his hematocrit was 22.8 he received 2 units of PRBCs,
follow up crit was:

Physical therapy was consulted and cleared patient for discharge
to home.
