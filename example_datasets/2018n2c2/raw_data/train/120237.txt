Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 86 year old female with a history of CAD, CHF, s/p
pacemaker implantation, who presented with a left thigh
hematoma, HCT drop and elevated INR, with acute renal failure.
She was admitted to the CCU on [**2136-7-18**].

#Acute renal failure: The patient had a baseline Cr of 1.4-2.0.
was 1.4 on [**7-15**]. Likely etiology is ATN (muddy-brown casts).
Pt's daughter reporting poor urine output at home. There was no
suspicion of obstructive physiology.  The Patient's fluid status
was initially unclear. She appeared to be dry and was given
fluid however she did not make urine appropriate to the fluid
bolus.  She became fluid overloaded and diuresis was attempted.
She did not respond well to Lasix and continued to retain fluid.
 Nephrology was consulted and recommended holding Lasix and that
the only remaining treatment options for her was dialysis.
Lasix drip was attempted for fluid removal as family did not
want to put patient on dialysis.  The patient's creatinine
continued to rise and was 4.1 on [**7-29**].
.
# CAD: Pt with a h/o MI, s/p stenting [**2128**] to LAD. Originally
report was that pt had a Troponin of 30 at [**Year (4 digits) 16962**]. However, trop T
on admission was 1.40. Elevated enzymes could have been due to a
cardiac event but it was felt that the patient was a poor
candidate for any intervention.  ECG was unchanged and the
patient was without cardiac symptoms. Cardiac enzymes trended
down over admission.
.
# CHF: The patient had a history of Systolic HF. Last echo with
EF 15-20%. The pati net initially received fluid boluses to help
determine etiology of renal failure, however she was unable to
remove volume and not candidate for dialysis.  Patient comfort
made main goal of therapy.
.
# A-FIB: The patient had a history of afib and was s/p pacemaker
placement.She was vpaced (VVI) at the time of admission. Her
Pacer rate increased to attempt to help cardiac output however
this did not have an effect on urine output.
.
# Anemia: The patient had a history of anemia. Baseline HCT
34-38 but was noted to be 22 on admission. Likely etiology is
from suspected bleed-in the area of the L.thigh, likely
spontaneous in the setting of supratherapeutic INR. CT
abd/pelvis/L.thigh ruled out RP and rectus sheath bleed, thigh
hematoma seen. The patient was not transfused blood as
hematocrit stabilized and patient already in heart failure.
.
#history of C.diff- The patient was initially continued on her
suppressive vancomycin therapy, but was stopped with negative
C.diff toxins.
.
# Pain/Palliation/End of life: A family meeting was held on [**7-29**]
and the options/goals of care were discussed.  It was felt that
the patient's renal failure required dialysis and the family was
clear that this was not a therapy they wished to pursue.  It was
agreed that patient would stop medications that were only
present because of long term benefit and that patient comfort
would be the goal of care.  Patient moving towards CMO, no oral
medications and the patient was started on Dilaudid for pain
control.  She was continued on telemetry for family comfort.
Over the next 3 days, the patient's mental status declined and
she became less responsive.  On [**8-1**], the patient was surrounded
by her daughters and care givers when she was noted to become
asystolic. No intervention was attempted.  The patient appeared
to die peacefully and without pain.  She was pronounced dead at
4:24pm.
