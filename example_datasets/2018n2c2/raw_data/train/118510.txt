Attending:[**Doctor First Name 5911**]
Chief Complaint:
Ms. [**Known lastname 111230**] presented for scheduled laparoscopic bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomies due to bilateral ovarian cysts with
solid components.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies,
pelvic peritoneal washings with emergent conversion to
laparotomy for repair of trocar injury to left common iliac
artery and vein.
2. Primary repair of left common iliac artery.
3. Primary repair of left common iliac vein.
4. Blood transfusion.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 111230**] is a 53-year-old G4, P4-0-0-4 perimenopausal
Caucasian female with bigeminy arrhythmia, depression, GERD, and
is S/P C/S x4 plus LTL. Ms. [**First Name (Titles) 111231**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a pelvic
ultrasound [**12/2179**] for complaints of abnormal bleeding.  It
revealed a 7.7 cm right posterior cul-de-sac cyst separate from
the right ovary and a 3.5 cm simple left ovarian cyst.  The
uterus measured 10.9 cm but was otherwise unremarkable with
endometrial stripe of 8 mm.  She had a followup pelvic
ultrasound ([**2180-2-2**]) that revealed resolution of the 7.7 cm
posterior cul-de-sac cyst with a normal right adnexa.  She had
two left ovarian cysts sizing 2-2.5 cm.  Endometrial stripe
measured 1.1 cm with a questionable 6-mm endometrial polyp.
.
In regards to her endometrial lesion and abnormal bleeding, she
[**Year (4 digits) 1834**] an office endometrial biopsy ([**2180-1-18**]).  It
revealed scant inactive endometrium with no evidence of
endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy.  A diagnostic office
hysteroscopy ([**2180-4-19**]) revealed a normal endometrial cavity
with no evidence of any endometrial polyps or submucosal
fibroids.  There were no active issues regarding the endometrial
findings and the patient maintained expectant management.  In
regards to her abnormal bleeding, given the benign endometrial
biopsy and normal hematocrit, the patient opted to maintain
expectant management.
.
In regards to her pelvic and left ovarian cysts, it appeared
that the patient had remained asymptomatic and this was an
incidental finding.  The large 7.7 cm right posterior cul-de-sac
cyst had resolved spontaneously and the left adnexal cyst
appeared to be oscillating in size and simple in nature.
Therefore, the patient opted to maintain expectant management
with intermittent surveillance given her asymptomatic state.
.
She recently had a pelvic ultrasound at [**Location (un) 620**] under Dr.[**Name (NI) 14510**]
(PCP) instructions.  PUS ([**2182-11-12**]) at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] reveals a
uterus measuring 11 x 4.2 x 6 cm.  Endometrial stripe measured 7
mm.  No endometrial polyp was appreciated.  The right ovary
measured 3 cm in its greatest dimension with a large 8.9 x 4 cm
cyst containing some debris.  There was additionally a smaller
1.3 cm nodule within it.  A third cystic area with flow was also
noted along the edge of this large cystic lesion.  On the left,
the left ovary measured 5 cm in its greatest dimension and
contained a 2.2 cm simple cyst.  There was an additional 1.1-cm
solid nodule & a small amount of free fluid in the cul-de-sac.
.
She denied any symptoms related to these PUS findings such as
pelvic pain.  On review of her menstrual pattern, she does
report a pattern of oligomenorrhea consistent with
perimenopause.  She did skip her menses in [**4-/2182**], [**5-/2182**], and
[**6-/2182**] and has then resumed monthly menses in [**Month (only) 205**] with each
episode lasting roughly five to eight days.  The amount of
bleeding is lighter than her prior moderate to heavy flow noted
two years ago. The patient continues to remain asymptomatic.
Given the size of the lesions and the solid components, I
advised surgical management even though she remains
asymptomatic. After careful consideration, the patient would
like to proceed with surgical evaluation.  A plan for a
laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies with possible
conversion to laparotomy was discussed.  Pelvic peritoneal
washings will be obtained.  We also discussed the need for a
staging procedure should surgical findings reveal a malignant
condition.  The patient was consented for a laparoscopic
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies, pelvic peritoneal washings,
possible laparotomy, and possible staging procedure.  She
understands that a staging procedure will be performed by one of
our gynecologic-oncologist here at [**Hospital1 18**] if indicated (greatly
appreciated).  The nature of the surgery, potential surgical
risks, likely hospital and postoperative course were discussed
with the patient in detail today.  Informed consent was
obtained.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 111230**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] laparoscopic bilateral
salpingoophorectomies and pelvic washings that was complicated
by a trocar injury to the left common iliac artery and vein
injury.  She had an emergent conversion to a laparotomy with a
primary vessel repair (with assistance from Gynecologic
Oncology, General Surgery, and [**Last Name (Titles) **] Surgery-- please see
operative reports for details). Ms. [**Known lastname 111230**] was transferred
after the procedure to the ICU intubated, in stable conditon.
Patient was extubated in AM POD#1 and called out of the ICU.
Her course is described below by system:
.
RESPIRATOY: Ms. [**Known lastname 111230**] was extubated on post-operative day #1
and had no respiratory complications during her admission.
.
HEME: Ms. [**Known lastname 111230**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1801**] was noted to have a consumptive
coagulopathy. She recieved a total of 10u PRBC, 7u FFP, 1000cc
Cellsaver, 1u plts in terms of blood products. Her
post-operative HCT was stable.  The INR and fibrinogen were
followed and noted to normalize by discharge. She remained
hemodynamically stable and never required pressors in her
post-operative course.
.
[**Last Name (Titles) **]: [**Last Name (Titles) **] surgery followed her as a consultative
service and advised q4 hour pulse checks, bedside ABIs, DVT
prophylaxis (SC hep ppx transitioned to 81mg aspirin daily),
compression stockings as outpatient, activity restrictions as an
outpatient and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
ID: Ms. [**Known lastname 111230**] was treated with a broad spectrum antibiotic
regimen including vancomycin, Cipro, and Flagyl from [**1-9**] until
[**1-12**]. She remained afebrile on and off antibiotics.
.
FEN/GI: Patient complained of nausea.  She was treated with
Zofran, Protonix, Reglan, Tums, and Bicitra for nausea likely
secondary to medications and GERD. She had bowel movements,
flatus and no abdominal distension, making the diagnosis of
ileus unlikely. Her diet was advanced as tolerated. Nutrition
was consulted to ensure appropriate calorie intake. Ms.
[**Known lastname 111232**] weight was noted to be elevated and her exam revealed
edema from fluid retention. She responded well to diuresis with
IV lasix.
.
NEURO: Ms. [**Known lastname 111232**] pain was well-controlled with a morphine
PCA which was transtioned to po vicodin on [**2183-1-13**] POD#4.  She
demonstrated full neurologic function and was alert and oriented
throughout her recovery.
.
OTHER: Social work consult was offered to aid in family coping
and deconditioning, but patient declined. Patient with strong
family support.  Physical therapy was consulted.
.
She recovered smoothly and was transferred from the ICU to the
VICU on POD#1, then to a regular floor on post-operative day #5
and discharged home on postoperative day #6 in good condition:
ambulating and urinating without difficulty, tolerating a
regular diet, and with adequate pain control using PO
medication. She had follow-up with the [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] and gynecology
services.
