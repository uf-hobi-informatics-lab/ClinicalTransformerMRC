none

History of Present Illness:
44 year old male with history of multiple sclerosis, baseline
cognitive defects, chronic indwelling suprapubic catheter and
recurrent resistant urinary tract infections presenting with
UTI. He was recently hospitalized [**Date range (3) 45860**] for UTI
complicated by encephalopathy (somnolent, difficult to arouse).
Urine culture grew staph aureus; sensitivities were not back by
time of discharge. He improved on bactrim and discharged on 14
day course. However, sensitivities after discharge returned with
MRSA.
.
He was seen by his outpatient urologist (Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 770**])....

.
In the ED, initial VS: 95.1 75 151/100 16 97%. He received 1g IV
vancomycin. Previously, he had had an erythematous skin reaction
on the arm that vancomycin had been infusing. No history of resp
distress on vancomycin. Per ED, he had no ostensible reaction
while receiving the vancomycin. Per wife, he appeared more red
than usual in face and upper chest. Urology was called (but did
not officially consult) and agreed with admission to medicine
with urology following.
.
Within minutes of arrival to the floor, patient began to have
active seizures. Per wife, he does not have history of seizures
and was conversing and at baseline mental status while in ED. He
began to groan, head moving side to side, upper extremities
twitching and outstretched. During the first episode, he had
oxygen desaturation briefly to the mid 70s on room air for a few
seconds. Blood pressure was in systolic 180s; HR in 110s. He
then fell into stupor and within a few minutes again became
tremulous in upper extremities. Pupils were not reactive to
light. He received a total of 10mg iv ativan. Neurology was
consulted who recommended 1g loading dose of iv fosphenytoin.
Wife confirmed that pt is [**Name (NI) 835**]/DNR.

Studies
EEG [**3-18**]: CONTINUOUS EEG RECORDING: Began at 12:05 on [**3-18**]
and continued until 7:O0 the next morning. At the beginning, it
showed a low voltage faster pattern in all areas with bursts of
focal slowing especially in the left temporal region. There were
also some runs of rhythmic 6 Hz slowing in the left temporal
area and other runs of periodic slowing with sharp features,
none lasting for more than 8-10 seconds or so. On video, they
did not appear to have any clinical correlate. By the
evening, the background was more suppressed and, while left
temporal
slowing was still evident, the sharp features were not. SPIKE
DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed a few of the left temporal sharp
features, especially early in the record. SEIZURE DETECTION
PROGRAMS: Showed no electrographic seizures. PUSHBUTTON
ACTIVATIONS: There were none. SLEEP: No normal waking or sleep
patterns were evident. CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally
regular rhythm. IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no
pushbutton activations. There was continued focal slowing in the
left temporal region. Early in the record, this also included
some runs of irregular sharp activity and some 6 Hz rhythmic
slowing in the same area, but these episodes did not appear to
show any clinical evidence of seizure on video. They were brief.
No more prolonged and clear electrographic seizures were
recorded.

CXR [**2118-3-18**]: Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates low lung
volumes and worsening basilar atelectasis. The left PICC has
been removed. There is no focal consolidation, large pleural
effusion, or pneumothorax. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured.

MR head [**2118-3-19**]: FINDINGS: The study is compared with most
recent enhanced MR examination of [**2-/2118**], as well as the remote
study of [**2109-9-11**].
Again demonstrated is the extensive confluent
T2-/FLAIR-hyperintensity
throughout bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white
matter, with similar abnormality involving the posterior fossa,
including the brainstem, cerebellar peduncles and cerebellar
hemispheres. Allowing for the motion artifact, above, the
overall appearance is unchanged. By and in-large, the extensive
lesions demonstrate intrinsic T1-hypointensity, representing
"black holes" of irreversible demyelination. However, there is a
prominent curvilinear or "targetoid" 16 mm focus of enhancement
in the right corona radiata with a possible second enhancing
focus in the corresponding location on the left. The right-sided
focus appears new since the [**4-/2117**] examination, though
previously, there was a smaller, more nodular focus in the
immediately adjacent centrum semiovale. Allowing for the marked
limitation in the post-contrast imaging, no other definite
enhancing focus is seen, with apparent interval resolution of
the left-sided subcortical white matter, temporal lobar and
cerebellar hemispheric foci. Currently, there is no pathologic
leptomeningeal or dural focus of enhancement.  There is no
definite focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute ischemic
event, and the principal intracranial vascular flow-voids,
including those of the dural venous sinuses are preserved and
these structures enhance normally.  In comparison to the more
remote study there is no definite progression of the marked
global atrophy (particularly given the patient's age) or the
severe diffuse atrophy of the corpus callosum. Limited imaging
of the upper cervical spinal cord, through the mid-C4 level,
demonstrates no definite abnormality.
IMPRESSION: The study, particularly the post-contrast MP-RAGE
acquisition, is quite limited by motion artifact, with:
1. No significant change in the overall extensive demyelinating
"disease
burden." 2. Curvilinear rim-enhancing focus in the right corona
radiata appears new since the [**2117-4-6**] study and likely
represents a site of active inflammation; allowing for the
limitation above, there is no definite additional enhancing
focus, with apparent interval resolution of many of the foci
demonstrated on that study. 3. Marked global and corpus callosal
atrophy, not significantly changed since the [**9-/2109**] study.

CXR [**2118-3-25**]: : A right-sided PICC terminates within the distal
SVC. The aeration of the lungs has improved compared to the
prior study. Cardiac silhouette is stable. No large pleural
effusions are seen.  There is no pneumothorax. Bones are intact.
IMPRESSION: Right-sided PICC terminating within the distal SVC.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 45855**] is a 44yoM with h/o multiple sclerosis, baseline
cognitive defects, chronic indwelling suprapubic catheter and
recurrent resistant urinary tract infections presenting with a
UTI and new onset seizures.
.
After initially being admitted to the floor, he developed
seizures requiring 10mg IV ativan and started on fosphenytoin
with a load and transferred to the MICU.  He was noted to be
increasingly somnelent with periods of central apenea.  ABG
showed acidemia with CO2 on the 70s.  He was started on Bipap
with improvement in his CO2.  It was presumed that his central
apnea was secondary to his large ativan dose which slowly
improved with clearance of the ativan.  He was started
emperically on vanc/ctx/amp/acyclivir to cover both his UTI and
for empiric coverage for meningitis given his AMS. A head MRI
was done, which showed unchanged appearance of extensive
demyelinated, w/ new curvilinear rim focus in corona radiatia,
likely site of active inflammation, no evidence of ischemic
event, unchanged marked global atrophy. Given that meningitis
was less likely he was narrowed to vanc/[**Known lastname **].  He began to
wake up over the day on [**3-19**] and was weaned off BiPap to a
shovel mask and transferred to the floor.
.
On the floor, he remained stable throughout the day on [**3-20**].
However, that morning was noted to be more tachycardic and
febrile to 103 in the setting of hypoxia to the 80s.  He was put
on a NRB and sats remained in the 80s for a while before
improving to the mid- 90s.  ABG on NRB was 7.48/40/72.  His eyes
were open but wasn't following commands and appeared obtunded on
the floor. CXR on the floor showed no new infiltrate.  Patient
was transitioned to the MICU and briefly broadened to
vanco/[**Month/Year (2) **]/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia, but quickly
narrowed given rapid improvement of respiratory status.  By
morning patient was alert and oriented X3, communicating and
breathing comfortably on 2L nasal cannula with saturation in mid
to high 90s.  Abx were again narrowed to [**Month/Year (2) 21347**]/Vanco for
coverage of UTI. Patient was then called out to floor.
.
#) Seizures (new): several possible etiologies in this patient;
he has severe multiple sclerosis, and though he has never had a
seizure before, there is a new area of inflammation on his MRI.
Infectious causes in setting of severe MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 45861**]
seizures, most notably his UTI. He was started on fosphenytoin
IV initially, then transitioned to phenytoin PO once mental
status improved. There was no sign of further seizure activity.
He will f/u w/ [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in ~2 weeks
.
# Altered mental status: per wife, was at baseline until the
seizures. 24h EEG did not show status epilepticus. Mental status
then to near baseline by discharge suggesting largely resultant
from infections/medications/post-ictal state.
.
#) Apnea/Hypercarbia: fully resolved as his mental status
improved once coming out of the MICU the 2nd time.
.
#) UTI: growing MRSA and pseudomonas. He will is on
vancomycin/ceftazidime, and will complete a 14 day course. A
PICC line was insserted and home infusion company will assist w/
antibiotics. There was a question of home aids flushing his
foley, thus potentially introducing pathogens. There should be
no flushing of the foley and this was addressed w/ wife and in
page 1 instructions.
.
#) Rash w/ vancomycin: pt did develop red rash on arms and face
w/ vancomycin infusion. Component of redman syndrome was
suspected. Benedaryl was given w/ vancomycin and this improved
his symptoms. There was no other evidence of allergic disease,
and no facial swelling or airway obstruction.
.
#) Thrombocytopenia- Bseline ~150's, went downt to 89 this
admission. No signs of active bleeding. No rashes on exam. He
had been exposed to heparin in the last 30 days, so PF4 antibody
was checked and was negative. His platelets responded to
baseline by discharge, and likely this was all secondary to
acute infection.
.
#) Multiple sclerosis: initially held home home baclofen given
AMS, but restarted by discharge once mental status improved.
.
#) HTN: continued home amlodipine
.
# CODE: DNI/DNR (confirmed with wife)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr [**Known lastname 45855**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were admitted
for a urinary tract infection. You then developed seizures. You
had a head MRI, which showed a new area of multiple sclerosis,
and this plus the infection is probably why you had a seizure.
You were started on antibiotics and anti-seizure medications,
and got much better.

The following changes have been made to your medications:
** START phenytoin (dilantin) [anti-seizure medication]. Take
150mg in the morning and at noon, and 200mg at night (3 total
doses per day)
** START vancomycin [antibiotic]
** START ceftazidine [antibiotic]
** START benadryl, take 20 minutes before vancomycin infusion
