Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
GIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
colonoscopy
Central line placement by VIR

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 70011**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with severe RA who presented to OSH
with LGIB on [**11-11**]. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-gastric lavage was negative. Initally
the patient was hypotensive with SBP in the 80s. The patient was
given fluids and was transfused 2U of FFP and 2U of PRBC. Only
poor peripheral access was obtained (20G in foot) and therefore
a CVL was attempted. An attempt for a R femoral line was
unsuccessful. A RIJ attempt was unsuccessful as the wire was
traveling in the head. When trying to place a L subclavian line,
the physician in the OSH was unable to withdraw the wire. A CXR
revealed the CVL wire coiled in the IVC filter. The patient is
transfered for IR intervention to withdraw the wire.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient denied any CP, SOB,
abdominal pain, back pain. She denied any BRBPR prior to this
episode. She states that the BRBPR started last two days. The
patient denies ever having had any colonoscopy before. She
denies any LH or dizziness. The patient is s/p recent THR that
was complicated by a DVT. The pt had an IVC filter placed and
was on Heparin sc TID for DVT prophylaxis.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
Rheumatoid Arthritis - c/b chronic right pleural effusion, s/p
recent thoracentesis, felt to be due to RA
HTN
Atrial fibrillation
h/o of CVA with residual L sided weakness
Frequent UTIs
.
PSH:
S/p b/l TKR in [**2193**]
s/p R total hip replacement in [**9-/2198**] complicated by a DVT for
which an IVC filter was placed

Addendum/clarification based on discussion with the PCP ([**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 4468**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70012**]):

She underwent R THR at [**Hospital3 934**] in [**5-15**] without
complications, discharged on coumadin for DVT prophylaxis.
Readmitted in [**6-14**] with thigh pain and a DVT was seen.  On
lovenox, plavix and aspirin, she developed a thigh hematoma
complicated by hypotension, so anticoagulation was stopped and
they placed an IVC filter.  She was D/C'd to [**Location (un) 931**] House.
She was readmitted [**8-15**] for chest pain and hypotension and found
to have RA pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and pleuritis.
Placed on steroids.  Readmitted [**10-15**] for the same and also
developed A fib which spontaneously recovered.  Readmitted [**11-11**]
from rehab because she was placed on heparin SQ despite the IVCF
and developed BRBPR and hypotension.


Social History:
She has been living in a Rehab since her THR in [**9-14**]. Prior to
this, she lived alone with help from her son. She denies ETOH
and tobacco use.

Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
Gen: NAD, AAOx3
HEENT: PERRLA, mmm, no dentures in place
NECK: no LAD, no JVD visible
COR: S1S2, regular rhythm, non-radiating systolic murmur [**12-15**]
over precordium, distant heart sounds.
PULM: CTA b/l, no wheezing or rhonchi
ABD: + bowel sounds, soft, nd, nt
Skin: cool extremities, no rash, limited range of motion in UE
joints, ecchymosis in R groin, wire taped to her left shoulder
EXT: 1+ DP, no edema/c/c, dermatosclerotic changes in feet b/l


Pertinent Results:
[**11-11**]: EKG: rate 72, Nsr, no ST changes or TWIs, normal intervals

.
[**11-11**] CXR: Bilateral pleural effusions.  Subsegmental atelectasis
right
base.  Increased density in the retrocardiac area, which may
represent
atelectasis or consolidation.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
1.  CT colonography unable to be performed due to lack of rectal
tone.
2.  Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis.  Assessment of the
nondistended colon is limited, but there is an area of
asymmetric wall thickening with mucosal enhancement in a loop of
redundant sigmoid colon low in the left lower quadrant.  While
this could be related to recent colonoscopy or represent
inflammatory changes from diverticulosis, given the history of
GI bleeding, a neoplastic process cannot be excluded. Targeted
colonoscopy of this area or single-contrast barium enema could
be performed for further assessment. Given lack rectal tone,
single contrast enema may not be successful.
3.  Findings consistent with proctitis.
4.  Air in the bladder.  Correlate with recent history of Foley
catheter
placement. Given extensive diverticular disease, in the absence
of prior Foley catheterization, this would raise suspicion for
enterovesicular fistula.  No areas of asymmetric bladder wall
thickening are identified adjacent to sigmoid colon to indicate
an enterovesicular fistula.
5.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated
bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] F with PMH of RA, THR c/b DVT, s/p IVC filter placement,
admitted to MICU with LGIB.
.
1) LGIB: Patient presented to outside hospital with lower GI
bleed and hypotension.  She received 2 units of FFP and 2 units
of PRBC's at outside hospital and was subsequently transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  She was admitted to the MICU
at [**Hospital1 18**] and GoLytely was administered in preparation for a
colonoscopy.  On admission to this institution, she had a large
drop in her hct from 33.8 to 26.6 and was transfused an
additional 2 units of PRBC's and started on IV PPI.  She was
subsequently hemodynamically stable for the duration of her
hospital course.  EGD/colonoscopy revealed ischemic-appearing
mucosa in the sigmoid colon and severe sigmoid narrowing, which
they were unable to pass with the colonoscope.  She underwent a
diagnostic colonography under fluroscopy for further evaluation
of  stricture vs. obstructing mass.  This study revealed severe
sigmoid diverticulosis and findings consistent with proctitis.
If indeed these findings are consistent ischemic colitis, it may
be related to hypotensive event (reported per PCP) which
occurred at outside hospital.  At time of discharge, she was
hemodynamically stable, and no further intervention was advised.
 This was discussed with both patient's son and her PCP who
stated their agreement with plan for conservative management.
.
2) Access:  At the outside hospital, Ms. [**Known lastname 70011**] had several
unsuccessful attempts at line placement and was transferred with
a guidewire which was felt to be hooked into her IVC filter.  IR
found that in fact this was not the case, and they were able to
remove the wire without difficulty. A left SVC triple lumen
catheter was placed by IR for access in the setting of active GI
bleeding, as patient had a tenuous situation with peripheral
IV's.
.
3) Rheumatoid Arthritis - Patient has a long history of RA for
30 years and is on a slow prednisone taper for recent RA
pericarditis & pleuritis.  Current dose of 20 mg was continued
to prevent adrenal insufficiency.  Her PCP will continue to
manage the slow taper after discharge.
.
4) Leukocytosis:  Most likely due to chronic prednisone.  No
clinical, radiographic, or other laboratory evidence of
infection.
.
5) Afib:  Sotalol was briefly held secondary to concern over
brisk bleeding.  Once GI bleeding had subsided, it was
restarted.  Heart rate was well-controlled.  She is not
currently a candidate for anticoagulation given GI bleed.
.
6) FEN: Received gentle IVFs initially following admission.
Following colonoscopy, diet was slowly advanced from clear
liquids to regular cardiac diet, which patient tolerated well.
Electrolytes were repleted as needed to maintain K>4, Mg>2.
.
7) Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.  Patient has
IVC filter in place given h/o DVT.  PPI for GI prophylaxis.
.
8) Access: L SCV line placed by IR; removed prior to discharge.

.
9) Code status: DNR/DNI

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital 941**] - [**Location 942**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
PRIMARY:
GI bleed
Diverticulosis
Ischemic colitis
Gastritis
CVL wire coiled in IVC filter
.
SECONDARY:
Atrial fibrillation
Hypertension
Rheumatoid arthritis
Pericarditis
Pleuritis


Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted from [**Hospital **] Hospital with a catheter coiled
in the filter in your inferior vena cava.  You were evaluated by
Interventional Radiology, and the catheter was disentangled.
.
You have also been evaluated for the source of your GI bleeding.
 Initially you received a blood transfusion to stabilize your
hematocrit.  Your colonoscopy showed evidence of diverticulosis
and of ischemia in your sigmoid colon (which means that your
bowel may not be getting adequate blood supply to it).  Ischemic
colitis is likely the source of your lower GI bleed. There is no
further intervention necessary for these conditions.  Your
bleeding has subsided, and you have been hemodynamically stable
for several days.
.
You should return to the hospital if you experience gross blood
in your stool, shortness of breath, or chest pain.


Followup Instructions:
You will follow-up with your primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 70012**].
