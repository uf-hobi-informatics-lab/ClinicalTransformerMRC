Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]
Chief Complaint:
direct admit from OSH for transplant work-up

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis
Placement of tunnel line for hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
Pt is 54 yo male with alcoholic cirrhosis, h/o esophageal
varices, who has had multiple recent admissions to Southern
[**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center for ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Pt
presented recently to the OSH with encephalopathy, and developed
oliguric ARF, severe hyponatremia, and severe hyperkalemia. He
also had a transaminitis on admission to OSH, which improved
during his hospital stay. He had diarrhea, and was found to be
positive for C.dif (presumably [**1-1**] recent Abx treatment for
SBP), and was placed on flagyl. He was treated with octreotide,
midodrine, and albumin for likely HRS. He was initially treated
with levofloxacin, but this was d/c'd after a negative urine cx.
Pt also reportedly underwent therapetuic paracentesis (12 L
removed) 1 week ago. Pt was evaluated for TIPS procedure,
however this was deferred until pt could be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation.
.
Pt currently complains only of feeling "bloated". He denies
abdominal pain, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain,
SOB.

Pertinent Results:
DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL  [**2150-6-26**] 2:01 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent portal vein, with waveforms suggestive of stagnant
flow, without specific evidence of intraluminal thrombus.
2. Please see report from previous ultrasound regarding
description of left hepatic mass.
.
[**2150-6-26**] ABD U/S: [**2150-6-26**] 8:06 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. 2.2 cm hypoechoic mass in left hepatic lobe that is
concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma.
2. Ascites marked for paracentesis at right lower quadrant.
3. Splenomegaly.
.
[**2150-6-29**] MRI ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis and evidence of portal hypertension given
portosystemic collaterals, splenomegaly, and large volume
ascites.
2. 1.7 cm lesion within segment VIII with unusual enhancement
characteristics; however, which does contain an 8 mm peripheral
nodule which contains some microscopic fat, early hepatocellular
carcinoma cannot be excluded. A hemangioma would be much less
likely.
3. No portal venous enhancement on the post-contrast images,
these findings are suspicious for portal vein thrombosis.
.
[**2150-7-1**] ABD U/S:
IMPRESSION:
No flow seen within the portal vein. It may represent
thrombosis.
Lesion in right lobe of liver, which may represent
hepatocellular carcinoma and previously identified on ultrasound
and MR.
Ascites. Splenomegaly. Splenic varices.
.
[**2150-7-3**] ABD U/S:
CONCLUSION:
Thrombosis of intrahepatic portal vein. Ascites. Approximately
2.5 cm area of low echogenicity in relation to the right lobe of
liver which may represent a hepatocellular CA. Splenomegaly.
Splenic varices.
.
[**2150-7-16**] ABD CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis.
2. Large amount of ascites.
3. Portal vein thrombosis extends 1-cm into the superior
mesenteric vein and 1.5-cm into the splenic vein.
4. Large right pleural effusion with atelectasis of the right
lower lobe.
5. Ileus.
.
[**2150-7-17**] Portable abdomen:
ABDOMEN, SINGLE AP SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW.
The lateral aspects of the abdomen are not included on this
film, nor are the obturator foramina. Residual oral contrast is
present in portions of the colon. There are multiple air-filled
dilated loops of small bowel in a stepladder configuration.
Nonethe less, air is seen throughout much of the colon. No
supine film evidence of free air is identified. No bowel wall
thickening is detected and no intramural emphysema is seen. Note
that many forms of hemorrhage would not be evident
radiographically.
.
There appear to be rib fractures in the left posterior ninth and
tenth ribs and question eleventh rib near the costovertebral
junction. The possibility of metastatic lesions in these areas
cannot be excluded.
.
Residual contrast is noted in the bladder.
.
[**2150-6-27**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology identified,
including no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
.
[**2150-7-2**] CHEST CT:
IMPRESSION:
1) 4 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule. 3 month follow up
chest CT is recommended in this patient with possible
hepatocellular carcinoma.
2) Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated mild
compressive atelectasis.
3) Bilateral upper lobe peripheral ground glass opacities are
likely inflammatory in etiology or due to resolving pulmonary
edema.
4) Cirrhosis with portal hypertension.
.
[**2150-7-3**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Stable mild pulmonary edema and small right pleural
effusion.
.
[**2150-7-2**] BONE SCAN:
IMPRESSION: 1) Increased tracer activity in region of right
sternoclavicular joint may be degenerative. If isolated osseous
metastasis is considered, then correlation with CT may be of
value. 2) Ascites. 3) If additional characterization of liver
lesion is desired, then a blood pool study may be useful in
evaluation of a possible hemangioma.
.
[**2150-7-8**] RENAL U/S:
RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 10.3 cm, and the
left kidney measures 10.8 cm. There is limited evaluation of the
lower pole of the right kidney. There are no renal masses,
stones, or hydronephrosis. The echogenicity of the kidneys is
normal. Ascites is noted in the right upper and lower quadrants.
The bladder is partially collapsed.
There is a small nodular liver consistent with known cirrhosis.
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Ascites.
.
[**2150-7-8**] RENAL U/S:
Conclusions:
Suboptimal study.
.
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. The LV is not well seen but
limited views demonstrate normal regional left ventricular wall
motion.. Overall left ventricular systolic function appears
normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation

Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo M w/ETOH cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus, DM, ARF p/w
ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and w/u for liver transplant
.
# CIRRHOSIS: Patient's cirrhosis most likely secondary to
alcohol and patient was admitted with multiple complications.
Ultrasound at OSH demonstrated possible portal vein thrombosis,
although this finding was not present on 1st doppler study at
[**Hospital1 18**]. Patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis many times
during this admission. He was always negative for SBP. He was
continued on cipro for SBP prophylaxis. Pt's initial U/S was
unremarkable for portal vein thrombus, subsequent Abd U/S with
doppler as well as CT and MRI, notable for Portal vein thrombus.
Anticoagulation was contraindicated given his thrombocytopenia,
pt also developed some oozing around temporary central lines.
His clot then extended into SVC and was no longer a candidate
for transplant surgery. Further transplant work up stopped and
pt was made DNR/DNI given no further options for treatment.
.
# RENAL FAILURE: Patient was admitted with oliguric renal
failure. Patient's renal function decreased rapidly during this
episode of hepatic decompensation,  suggesting hepatorenal
syndrome although likely compounded by intravascular depletion
and increased intra-abdominal pressure. Patient was started on
octreotide, midodrine, and albumin at the OSH. Patient's SBP
dropped during HD from base line BP of 90's to low 80's. He was
then transferred to the ICU for CVVH. He tolerated several
sessions of HD. Plan for continued HD as outpatient as pt would
like to continue HD. Plan was to provide HD as outpatient close
to home. The patient was admitted to the MICU for ongoing CVVHD
given his pressures were prohibitive for traditional HD. The
patient was maintained on midodrine and octreotide for possible
hepatorenal syndrome and was additionally treated with IV
albumin, which was discontinued on [**2150-7-11**]. Midodrine was
increased to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. The patient's pressures tolerated CVVHD
well and his creatinine decreased from 5.9 to 2.5. He has
required dialysis, though, since being transferred from the MICU
to the floor, and his renal function has not improved.
Unfortunately, given his coagulopathy, he has had issues with
bleeding from the dialysis catheter site following dialysis. He
did not bleed following his last course of hemodialysis and was
deemed safe to go home.
.
# COAGULOPATHY: Pt developed some oozing around line sites. Labs
showed picture consistent with DIC but this could also be from
underlying liver disease. He received FFP/Cryo before
procedures. He recieved several units of PRBC for low HCT but
remained stable. Had some bleeding from tunneled line. Was given
conjugated estrogen and Vitamin K x 3 doses.
.
# HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: During this admission, patient had
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, suggesting likely hepatic
encephalopathy. Patient's mental status much improved with
lactulose therapy. The patient was maintained on lactulose for
encephalopathy. He was noted to have some fluctuation in mental
status but was generally appropriate and oriented.
.
# LIVER MASS: Patient also noted to have hepatic mass on
abdominal ultrasound, suggestive for possible HCC although AFP
only 2.9. Unclear etiology of mass.
