[**2109-6-2**]: chest x-ray:

Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
Clear lungs

[**2109-6-2**]: x-ray of the abdomen:

FINDINGS: Supine AP portable view of the abdomen and pelvis were
obtained. A vertical line of skin surgical staples is seen
coursing in the midline. The inferior aspect of a nasogastric
tube is seen coiling in the left upper quadrant, in the expected
location of the stomach. Coursing into the left upper quadrant,
is a curvilinear radiopaque structure consistent with a JP
drain. Additional scattered staples are seen projecting over the

groin/buttock bilaterally, noted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to be external
to the patient, staples holding down drapes. No radiopaque
foreign body concerning for surgical sponge or instrument is
seen. No evidence of bowel obstruction.

[**2109-6-3**]: chest x-ray:

 FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-2**], the endotracheal
and
nasogastric tubes remain in satisfactory position. The pulmonary
vascularity in the apical region is somewhat sparse bilaterally,
though no definite pleural line to indicate pneumothorax. If
this is a clinical concern, repeat expiration view could be
obtained.






Brief Hospital Course:
 22 year old gentleman admitted to the acute care service with
an abdominal stab wound.  He was intubated at the scene
requiring fluid resuscitation including blood products. He was
hemodynamically stable upon transport. Upon admission, he was
taken emergently to the operating room where he underwent an
oversewing of an anterior-posterior gastrotomy.  He also had an
injury to a branch of a gastric vessel which was oversewn.
Because there was a concern for an aortic injury, he was
evaluated by the Vascular team.  He was found not to have an
aortic injury.
 During his operative course, he had a 500cc blood loss and
received 1 UPRBC.  He was monitored in the intensive care unit
after the procedure.  He had an NG tube in place and a JP drain.
On POD #1 he was extubated.  His incisional pain was managed
with a morphine PCA and changed to a dilaudid PCA because of
reports of nausea.  He was transported to the surgical floor POD
#1. He was evaluated by Social services  and they have provided
additional support to him and his family and made
recommendations about the availibility of community programs.
His foley catheter was discontinued on POD #2 and he voided
without difficulty.  His vital signs are stable and he is
afebrile.  His hematocrit has stablized at 36.6.  His
[**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube was discontinued on POD #3 and his JP drain
was d/ced prior to his discharge.
He had mild nausea which has been controlled with an
anti-emetic. He had been out of bed.His diet was slowly advanced
which he tolerated well.His diet was advanced to regular and he
was started on oral pain meds on [**2109-6-7**] which he tolerated
well.
He was discharged on [**2109-6-8**], when he was tolerating a regular
diet, voiding normally and ambulating without any difficulty. He
would follow up with the [**Hospital 2536**] clinic in [**12-30**] weeks.
