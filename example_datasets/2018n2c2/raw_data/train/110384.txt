Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status requiring intubation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation w/ mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 48y/o M with PMH of Hepatitis C, inoperable HCC and
alcoholic cirrhosis admitted with encephalopathy after being
found unresponsive with an empty bottle of oxycontin nearby. Pt
has a longstanding history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis and
Hepatitis C with associated portal hypertension, varices,
ascites and encephalopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma. His
most recent scans are notable for recurrence of his
hepatocellular carcinoma following his radiofrequency ablation
(5/[**2118**]). At his most recent oncology visit on [**2118-10-5**], he was
found to have a rapid deterioration in his liver function and
was felt not to be a candidate for further cancer-directed
therapies.

Per report, on the day of this admission, he was found to be
unresponsive by his family and was taken to [**Hospital3 **].
There he was intubated for airway protection in the setting of a
GCS of 8. CT A&P demonstrated an advanced tumor of the left lobe
of the liver and abdominal varices. RLL consolidation consistent
with PNA was also seen. CT Head negative for acute process. He
was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managemnt. He was given zosyn and
clindamycin as treatment for his pneumonia. OG tube showed brown
aspirate and he was given zantac for GI protection.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], T 95.9, HR 91, BP 136/96, RR 18. He was
given 1 L NS and transferred to MICU.

Past Medical History:
1.  Cirrhosis Child's class C, complicated by varices,
encephalopathy, and ascites.
2.  Hepatitis C secondary to IV drug use.
3.  Hepatocellular carcinoma status post RFA in [**2118-5-5**].
4.  Alcohol abuse, hx of DTs.

years.  Alcohol use per HPI.  No current IV, illicit or herbal
drug use.  He is not currently sexually active.  He is on
disability.  Recently broke up with his girlfried, which is an

The ET tube is seen in situ with its tip approximately 13 mm
from
the carina. The NG tube is seen traversing the gastroesophageal
junction and following a course towards the stomach. There are
bibasal effusions along with atelectasis/probable consolidation
at the lung bases. Follow up with AP and lateral chest
radiographs would be helpful to assess for atelectasis vs.
consolidation. There is apparent deformity of the left humeral
head which is not well visualized and if there is suspicion of
trauma to the left shoulder joint, dedicated views of the left
shoulder would be helpful.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is a 48y/o M with PMH of Hepatitis C, HCC and alcoholic
cirrhosis admitted with altered mental status requiring
intubation for airway protection in the setting of suspected
opioid overdose.

Encephalopathy - The etiology of the patient's AMS was likely
multifactorial involving end stage liver disease,?anoxic-insult
given unknown down time, and opiate toxicity. Head CT negative
at OSH.  Upon admission, the patient was sedated and intubated.
Pt began regimen of lactulose with >4BMs per day; with a
decrease in NH4 from 140-->38 during his MICU stay. The
patient's mentation improved during his admission, sedating
medications were weaned down before extubation, and upon
transfer out of MICU he was A&O to person and place and
following commands.  Pt. was on CIWA on transfer to floor and
gradually cleared w/ less and less lorazepam. AT time of D/C he
was A/Ox3 for several days.

Respiratory failure/PNA ?????? Pt was intubated for unresponsiveness
and a GCS of 8 at an OSH. CT of chest demonstrated RLL
consolidation c/w possible aspiration PNA.  Upon admission to
the MICU, the patient was still intubated and sedated with
propofol. Empiric zosyn was started for coverage of aspiration
PNA which was changed to Unasyn on [**10-11**]. Repeat CXR on [**10-12**]
showed improving lung fields with no signs of consolidation.
Sputum GS grew GPCs in pairs, chains, and clusters on [**10-12**]. The
pateitn was weaned off sedation on [**10-11**], extubated, and placed
on 2LNC O2 with adequate oxygen saturation. Upon transfer, the
patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint. On the floor he
did not have any pulmonary distress, but did spike a fever to
102.5 while on unasyn, so he was switched to vanc/levo/zosyn.
His CXR was negative and he quickly defervesced so Abx were
stopped after a short course.

EtOH Cirrhosis/HepC/HCC ?????? Per recent history, the patient has a
h/o EtOH abuse, his HCC is rapidly progressing and his liver
function is rapidly declining. Upon admission, he had many
stigmata of liver disease, both on exam (encephalopathic,
scleral icterus, palpable mass in epigastric area c/w HCC mass
in left lobe, mild ascites, spider angioma, extensive
ecchymosis) and laboratory testing (elevated INR and abnormal
liver enzymes). Pt was given vit Kx1 without change in his INR.
The liver team was consulted and followed the patient during his
stay. An U/S of RUQ on [**10-12**] showed no signs of portal vein
thrombosis, cirrhosis and large infiltrative mass in the left
lobe of the liver c/w patient's known hepatocellular carcinoma;
there is probable new tumor ingrowth into the left portal vein
which is non-occlusive. Pt. was offered hospice house but could
not wait until this was available, he decided to leave AMA.

Hx of heavy EtOH abuse - The patient was maintained on CIWA
scale with 1mg of ativan per protocol in the MICU. The ativan
was weaned to 0.5mg on [**10-12**] and completely off two days later.
Pt. stated that he would continue to drink on d/c.

Hypotension: On [**10-11**], the patient developed hypotension to
80/40's. Likely secondary to physiology of hepatic failure and
possibly opioid toxicity. Given IVF boluses and bolus of albumin
with good response. Home BP medications were held. Pt remained
hemodynamically stable afterwards.

Guaiac + NGT aspirate - pt with history varices and significant
variceal bleeding, also EtOH abuse. Hct stable in mid-20's
during admission and hemodynamics not c/w acute bleed. The
patient was Type and Screened, adequate peripheral access was
achieved and he was placed on a PPI and Hct remained stable for
the duration of admission.

Discharge Instructions:
YOU ARE LEAVING AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE.
You have been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy and
hepatocellular carcinoma. You will need to take your lactulose
and Rifaximin exactly as prescribed so that you do not become
confused again. We stopped your clonidine and nadolol because
your blood pressure was low. We started you on a calcium
supplement because your nutrition was poor. We increased your
spironolactone to 200mg daily and your lasix (furosemide) to
80mg daily because your legs were swelling with fluid. We did
not change any of your other medications. We started you on
rifaximin to help stop you from getting confused.

Please take all of your medications exactly as prescribed.

If you have any confusion, fevers, chills, nightsweats, chest
pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, bleeding, black tarry
stools, vomiting blood or any other concerning symptoms call
