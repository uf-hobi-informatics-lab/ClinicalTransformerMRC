OSH s/p syncope and seizure, and with abnormal head CT.  In
summary, the patient was reportedly attending a funeral today
when she had a syncopal episode and fell.  She was sent to
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 189**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital for further evaluation.  Shortly following
admission, she was found slumped over and unresponsive in a
chair, and subsequently seized. Resolved with Ativan.  Continued
to seize 1-2 times later in the evening. Received a total of
14mg of Ativan. Intubated for increasing mental status changes
and lethargy.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continued care.

On Discharge:
Awake, alert and oriented to person, place and date. Face is
symmetric, tongue with a slight left deviation. Full strength
and sensation throughout. Wound is clean, dry and intact without
signs of infection.

Pertinent Results:
[**2104-5-19**] CT Head:
IMPRESSION: There are two rim-enhancing lesions peripherally
located within the right frontal lobe, as described above, with
associated vasogenic edema and mass effect. The inferior lesion
demonstrates a punctate focus of hemorrhage. While the superior
lesion does abut the dura, it lacks characteristic dural tail,
making meningioma a less likely consideration.  Moreover, the
more inferior lesion does appear intra-axial on coronal and
sagittal reformatted images. Differential diagnosis
includes metastatic disease versus abscess.

[**2104-5-19**] MRI Brain w/ & w/o:
1. Two enhancing right frontal lesions most consistent with
metastases with surrounding vasogenic edema and right frontal
sucal effacment.
2. 2mm leftward shift of midline structures.

CT Torso:
1. No definite evidence of malignancy. Consolidation within the
superior
segment of the left lower lobe may represent infection, but
there is a
slightly more rounded appearance inferiorly, and consider repeat
chest CT
following treatment. Prominent left-sided intrapulmonary lymph
nodes may be reactive.
2. Gallbladder sludge.
3. Gas tracking in the posterior subcutaneous tissues and
extending into the left paraspinal musculature and left psoas
muscle. Findings are likely
related to pressure erosion. There is no focal fluid collection.

4. Trace pelvic free fluid. Slightly limited evaluation of the
pelvis due to motion artifact, but no gross abnormalities are
identified.

CT head [**2104-5-22**]:
Expected postoperative appearance status-post right craniotomy.
Unchanged 2mm leftward shift of midline structures

MRI brain [**5-23**]:
1. Two curvilinear foci of residual enhancement of the right
frontal lobe.  Continued attention on followup studies is
recommended.
2. Interval resection of the two right frontal lesions.
Persistent,
unchanged right frontal edema and 2 mm leftward shift of midline
structures.
3. No evidence of acute infarct.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 54 year old F in her usual state of health until an
episode of syncope and seizure. OSH CT revealed a brain mass
with vasogenic edema. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where a
Head CT was repeated- again showing a  two rim-enhancing lesions
peripherally located within the right frontal lobe with
associated vasogenic edema and mass effect.  Pt was admitted to
the ICU under Dr.[**Name (NI) 9034**] care. A Brain MRI was done on
[**2104-5-19**] which showed two enhancing right frontal lesions most
consistent with metastases with surrounding vasogenic edema and
right frontal sulcal effacement

A CT Torso was done on [**5-19**], which was negative for any primary
lesion or mets, but did show ground glass opacity in RUL.

She was consented and pre-oped, and went to the OR for resection
of this mass on [**5-22**]. The procedure went well without
complications. The preliminary pathology report was metastatic
carcinoma. She remained in the PACU overnight for Q1 hour neuro
checks post-op. CT head was negative for hemorrhage.

She was stable on [**5-23**] and she was transferred to the Step down
unit. Her Foley and A-line was discontinued. She had an MRI.

PT and OT were ordered. She was cleared for home on [**5-26**] with PT
outpatient needs.
