Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated ([**2185-6-24**])

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
77M history of schizophrenia, neurogenic bladder presenting from
NH with ACS with resuscitation at [**Hospital1 2177**] 1 month ptp, brought in by
EMS due to hypoxia, concern for PNA at nursing home. The patient
is schizophrenic per history and is unable to provide a history
of his own.  Per discussion with the floor nurse from his
nursing home, a CXR was obtained 4 days prior to admission for a
cough that was consistent with a pneumonia.  He was started on a
Z-pack.  One day prior to admission, he developed tachypnea and
started to desaturated in the the low 80's.  EMS were call and
he was stat low 90's on a NRB.  He was brought in by Ambulance.

In the ED, initial VS were T 99, HR 120, BP 104/79, RR 24
satting 92% on NRB.  Labs showed WBC of 10.1, HCT of 43, plts
305.  LFTs showed AP of 214 otherwise WNL.  Coags were WNL.  CMP
showed hypernatremia of 150, Cl of 112, BUN 33, with rest of BMP
in normal range,  Lactate was 2.1, and valproate level was 27.
ABG was checked and pH was 7.51, pCO2 of 28, pO2 of 72.  Given
tachypnea and hypoxemia as well as high work of breathing,
patient was intubated with fentanyl and midazolam for sedation.
Noted was food in oropharynx/larynx per ED resident on
intubation.  His CXR showed a questionable aspiration pneumonia
as well as possible LLL process. CT scan showed bilateral PE and
likely pneumonia.  He was empricially provided with
levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.

His blood pressure dropped to 70/40 just before transfer to the
ICU. After an 3 additional 3L NS SBP increased to 100's.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
CT ANGIO CHEST [**2185-6-24**] -
TECHNIQUE:  CTA of the chest was performed per department
protocol.  Oblique sagittal and coronal reformats were available
for review along with the axial images.
CT OF THE CHEST:  There are small pulmonary arterial filling
defects in the subsegmental bronchi supplying the lingula (4:71)
as well as additional filling defect in the subsegmental right
lower lobe bronchi (4:87).  An additional area of segmental
pulmonary embolus is seen in the apical segment of the right
upper lobe (4:33).  There is no evidence of right heart strain.
Within the right middle and upper lobe there are extensive
nodular opacities as well as several more gound glass appearing
areas of opacity (4:61 and 4:27).  There is extensive
atelectasis of the right lower lobe (4.83) with relative
[**Name (NI) 71062**] peripheral area within the collapsed lung.  No
definitive arterial supply with embolus is seen in this area;
however in the setting of other emboli and configuration of this
finding, it is concerning for infarct.  There is no pleural or
pericardial effusion.  In the left hemithorax, there is a large
hiatal hernia with stomach and GE junction above the diaphragm.
This causes compressive atelectasis (4:102) on the adjacent
lung. The patient is intubated with endotracheal tube
terminating approximately 4 cm from the carina.  An nasogastric
tube is seen in the esophagus but does not reach the GE junction
or the stomach. Subdiaphgramatically, gallstones are seen. The
aorta and the great vessels appear unremarkable. No suspicious
lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen within the bones.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Right middle and upper lobe nodular opacities as well as
several areas of ground-glass opacity consistent with infectious
process.
2.  Bilateral pulmonary emboli in the segmental and subsegmental
levels with no evidence of right heart strain. There is an area
of hypoenhancement within the atelctatic right lower lobe along
the periphery concerning for infarction.
3.  Complete right lower lobe atelectasis.
4.  Large diaphgramatic hernia.
5.  Cholelithasis.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND [**2185-6-24**] -
Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of the left common femoral, left
superficial femoral, left popliteal vein show normal
compressibility, flow and augmentation.  Note is made of
duplicated left superficial femoral veins. The left calf veins
show normal flow. Grayscale, color, and spectral Doppler
examination of the right common femoral vein shows normal
compressibility and flow.   Note is made of duplicated right
superficial femoral veins. There is partially occlusive thrombus
noted within
one of the right proximal superficial femoral veins which is of
unclear
chronicity.  The distal superficial femoral vein, the entire
length of the
other superficial femoral vein,  popliteal vein appear patent.
The right
posterior tibial veins were patent.  The right peroneal veins
were not
visualized.

IMPRESSION:
1. Partially occlusive thrombus noted within one of the two
right proximal
superficial femoral veins which is of unclear chronicity. Right
peroneal veins were not visualized.
2. No DVT in left lower extremity.

ECHO [**2185-6-24**] -
Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  >= 55%  >= 55%

Findings
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to
position. Suboptimal image quality - ventilator.
Conclusions
Technically suboptimal study.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). No definate aortic regurfgitation is seen. The
mitral leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a very prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Very suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation.

CXR [**2185-6-26**]
Compared with [**2185-6-25**] at 5:46 a.m., an NG tube is again noted.
It overlies the lower chest, but appears to overlie the gastric
fundus, which is elevated due to a diaphragmatic herniation, as
seen on [**2185-6-24**] CT scan.  If clinically indicated, a lateral view
could help to confirm this. Again noted is ET tube in
satisfactory position above the carina. Prominence
of right paratracheal soft tissues is noted, but may be
accentuated due to
patient rotation.  There is focal opacity in the right upper
zone and patchy opacity in the right lower zone medially.  These
findings are better depicted on [**2185-6-24**] CT scan.  The lung apices
are excluded from the film. Electronic battery pack is noted
overlying left iliac crest.

CXR [**2185-7-6**]
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**7-5**], the orogastric
tube has been
removed.  Other monitoring and support devices remain in place.
Persistent
opacification at the left base with progressive clearing of
opacification at
the right base.  No vascular congestion.

CXR [**7-8**] Portable:
IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification in left base with some
volume loss.

CXR [**7-10**] Portable: IMPRESSION:  Possible area of loculated fluid
with trapped air verses pneumothorax verses atypical appearance
of stomach bubble near the left CPA. Follow up upright chest
radiograph with the patient swallowing 15 cc of barium just
prior to imaging should help rule out these etiologies

CXR [**7-11**] PA/Lat: CONCLUSION:
There is no significant pneumothorax.

ECG [**7-17**]: Sinus rhythm. Borderline low QRS voltage. Possible
inferior wall myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. The
lateral lead Q waves are likely not representative of a
myocardial infarction but rather septal Q waves. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2185-7-8**] the sinus rate has decreased by 20
beats per minute with no other diagnostic change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71063**] is a 77 yo M transferred from MICU [**7-7**] with
schizophrenia, neurogenic bladder, without guardianship, and
found to have pneumonia and bilateral pulmonary emboli causing
hypoxia/hypotension requiring pressors and intubation. He has
been relatively stable on the floor while undergoing treatment
for UTI.

# UTI- Currently has suprapubic catheter in setting of
neurogenic bladder and was found to have GNR's 10-100K in urine
on [**2185-7-3**]. Species on [**7-3**] was Alcaligenes achromobacter.
Patient complained of need to void urine on [**2185-7-11**] several
times which was new for him. His suprapubic catheter was changed
[**2185-7-13**] by urology. Levofloxacin was started on [**2185-7-11**] per
[**2185-7-3**] sensitivities; for total 14 day course (last day is
[**7-24**]).

# Acute Pulmonary Emboli: Patient previously on Coumadin. [**2185-6-24**]
CTA showed bilateral pulmonary emboli in the segmental and
subsegmental levels without evidence of right heart strain.
There was no clear cause for why he developed a PE. There was an
area of hypoenhancement within the atelectatic right lower lobe
along the periphery concerning for infarction. Increased
coumadin from 1mg po to 2mg po daily on [**2185-7-13**]. Further
increased coumadin from 2mg po to 4mg po daily on [**2185-7-16**]. His
INR has been difficult to manage, likely in setting of
antibiotics, malnutrition, Levothyroxine. On discharge, his
Coumadin has just been restarted at 3mg after he has been
supratherapeutic for the past 2 days. As an outpatient, he
should have his INR followed (check in 48-72hrs). If his INR <2,
he should be bridged with Lovenox 60mg q12h due to high risk for
thromboembolism. On discharge, he is on room air, slightly
tachypneic and tachycardic but has been stable.

# Tachycardia/Hypotension: Related to above.  Heart rates have
been in 80-110's. SBP <80s in the ICU requiring pressors.
Likely due to known pulmonary emboli with infection. Patient
does not currently have sx of infection, so sepsis is less
likely cause. It may be from pain, since patient is relatively
unable to communicate.

# Schizophrenia- Difficult to evaluate mental status. No
evidence of responding to internal stimuli. Baseline over past
few months [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3504**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] is that he is able to communicate
pain/discomfort but does not have capacity.  He is mostly lucid
but answers questions in mumbles and broken statements.  Patient
had court date for guardianship on [**2185-7-19**] which was approved.
He sometime says inappropriate comments but not frequently.
Patient was ambulatory in [**Month (only) 205**] with assistance per previous [**Hospital1 1501**].
We continued his Depakote, Risperdal, and Remeron.

# Pneumonia, MRSA: Treated with 8 day course of Vanc/Zosyn for
bilateral patchy infiltrate and found to be MRSA positive on
bronchial washings. Patient was hypotensive and hypoxic
requiring intubation and pressors for 10 days in MICU. Extubated
[**2185-7-6**]. [**2185-7-6**] CXR: Persistent opacification at the left base
with progressive clearing of right base without vascular
congestion. Later CXR cleared, he has finished treatment.

# Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine started this admission for TSH
8.6 in setting of acute septic shock. TSH 7.8 on [**2185-7-9**]. He
should continue levothyroxine 25mcg po daily. He will need
outpatient follow up of TSH in 1 month [**2185-8-8**]

# FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes prn, ground solids, if ever
needs tube feeds, needs post-pyloric b/c hiatal hernia

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Continued on Levofloxacin until [**7-24**]
- Guardianship obtained during admission.
- Will need outpatient psych follow-up
- He will need close management of coumadin with goal INR [**12-24**]
indefinitely. He should have a bridge with Lovenox 60mg q12 if
ever INR<2. Discharge Coumadin dose is 3mg.
- please check TSH and free T4 on [**2185-8-8**]. Patient started on
levothyroxine [**2185-7-3**] for low Triiodothyronine Thyroxine (T4),
Free 0.78* and TSH 8.5.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71063**], you were admitted to the [**Hospital1 827**] on [**2185-6-24**] for shortness of breath at your nursing
facility. You were found to have pneumonia with MRSA in your
lungs in addition to multiple blood clots in your lungs. This
required you to be in the intensive care unit on a ventilator
for over 1 week and requiring medicine to keep your blood
pressure normal. After you had several days of antibiotics for
your pneumonia, you were taken off the ventilator. Due to your
lung clots, you will need to be on coumadin (a blood thinner)
indefinitely. We have continued to change your dose depending on
your INR (which needs to be between [**12-24**] to help prevent blood
clots). You will be returning to your nursing home.  Please
follow up with your primary care physician.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your Primary Care physician at [**Name9 (PRE) **]
where you stay.
