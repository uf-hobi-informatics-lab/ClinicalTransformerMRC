History of Present Illness:
65F with history of sciatica and chronic low back pain,
presenting to [**Hospital3 10310**] hospital with worsening back pain,
now admit to MICU with altered mental status, renal failure and
multiple epidural abcesses.  She began to feel ill one week ago
when she acutely felt "awful" with low-grade fevers, back pain
and thought she had the flu.  She went to the ED, where she was
treated with ibuprofen, Vicodin and Tamiflu.  She stayed home
for the rest of the week resting her back, until the pain
worsened on Friday and she went to see her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was
diagnosed with sciatica and sent home with Percocet.  Over
Saturday and Sunday she became increasingly somnolent, sleeping
excessively and refusing to eat.  Initially she would still
drink water through a straw, but stopped doing that Sunday.  Her
husband called the [**Name (NI) **] for advice, and was told to call 911.  She
had not complained specifically of headaches and he did not
notice photophobia or neck stiffness.  She may have been
urinating less, but did not complain of dysuria.

EMS arrived to find her supine on the couch complaining of back
pain.  In the OSH ED her VS were T 99.6, HR 120, BP 132/68, 91%
on RA.   Given ceftriaxone, flagyl, clindamycin, and vancomycin.
 Episode of transient tachycardia to 120s that resolved with
fluids.  Found to have new ARF, a positive UA and leukocytosis
to 20K with 14% bands.  No imaging done there before she was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T97.9 HR103 113/76 R30 98% on
RA.  She was very somnolent and confused speech when awoken.
Noted to have pustular and petichial rash over torso and lower
extremities.  Difficult neurologic exam given cooperation.  Head
CT normal.  MRI performed that was concerning for multiple
diffuse epidural collections on a noncontrast scan limited
somewhat by motion.  Spine service was consulted, who reviewed
MRI and felt no spine compression - no surgical intervention
right now.  Lactate elevated.  She received vanco, ceftriaxone,
and was supposed to get ampicillin and acyclovir, which did not
happen prior to transfer.  Did not LP given concern for epidural
collections.  Blood cultures drawn (others pending at OSH) and
heme/onc consulted out of concern for TTP.

On the floor, she is somnolent but arousable and does open her
eyes.  She grimaces on movement of any of her extremities but
does not speak.  Will answer yes if asked if she has pain but
does not speak.
.

[**10-15**] MRI spine:
Multifocal small epidural collections as detailed above,
predominantly in the thoracic spine. No significant cord
compression is noted at any level.
Etiology for these collections could include infection or
hematomas.
Appearance is not suggestive of neoplasm, although correlation
with CSF
evaluation would be recommended.Evaluation is limited due to
lack of
contrast. Extensive degenerative changes in the lumbar spine
with clumping of nerve roots at L5-S1.
.
[**10-15**] CT head:
No acute intracranial process.
.
[**10-15**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
No evidence of hydronephrosis or obstructive renal calculi.
Given
noncontrast technique, pyelonephritis cannot be excluded.
Recommend clinical correlation.
.
[**10-16**] Echo:
No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant valvular
disease seen (reasonable-quality study). Normal global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary
hypertension. In presence of high clinical suspicion, absence of
vegetations on transthoracic echocardiogram does not exclude
endocarditis.
.
[**10-17**] CXR:
Findings suggestive interval worsening of mild-to-moderate
pulmonary edema; chronic interstitial lung disease may be
present.
.
[**10-20**] MRI Spine:
Overall no significant change compared to the previous study
with
the exam limited by motion. Severe degenerative changes are
identified with foraminal narrowing as above. The previously
noted tiny epidural collection at L5-S1 level is not apparent
but mild epidural enhancement is seen. No definite new
collection is identified.
.
[**10-20**] MRI Head:
No significant abnormalities on MRI of the brain with and
without
gadolinium.
.
[**10-21**] CT Pelvis:
1) No evidence of right hip infection or abscess. Note that MRI
or
radionuclide bone scan are more sensitive for the detection of
early
infection.
2) Diffuse anasarca.
.
[**10-25**] EMG/NCS:
Complex, abnormal study. The electrophysiologic findings are
consistent with
a severe, subacute multilevel polyradiculopathy involving
cervical and
lumbosacral myotomes diffusely and would be consistent with
either an
inflammatory/infectious meningeal process. The abnormalities are
most
pronounced in the midcervical region. In addition, there is
evidence for a superimposed neuromyopathy, as may be seen in
acute quadriplegic myopathy of intensive care.

[**10-30**] C-Spine Non-Trauma:
Five intraoperative radiographs of cervical spine with final
images showing both anterior and posterior fusion extending from
C4 through T1 posteriorly and C5 through T1 anteriorly. There is
an interbody anterior graft at C5-6 and apparently C7 body has
been partially replaced by a metallic device.
.
[**10-31**] MRI Head:
1. No acute infarction or hemorrhage.
2. Sinus disease as described above, the activity of which is to
be
determined clinically.
3. Enhancing fluid within the left temporalis region suggestive
of phlegmon. This enhancing collection previously demonstrated
restricted diffusion. Additional subcutaneous scalp fluid
collections in the bilateral parietal regions may represent soft
tissue edema; however, there is no evidence of enhancement to
suggest abscess.
.
[**10-31**] MRI L Spine:
1. New posterior epidural abscess extending from the level of
L4-L5 to the
level of S2 with phlegmonous extension into the paravertebral
and paraspinous musculature. No evidence of enhancing
intervertebral discs to suggest discitis.
2. Advanced degenerative changes of the lumbar spine, unchanged
since the
previous examination.
.
[**11-1**] MRI T spine:
1. Epidural abscesses are identified at the upper thoracic spine

involving the levels of T1, T2, and T3, apparently slightly
smaller since the prior examination, however, there is
persistent enhancement surrounding the thecal sac and the spinal
cord.
2. No evidence of abnormal signal within the thoracic spinal
cord.
3. Epidural abscess is again demonstrated at the level of T7/T8,
causing
anterior thecal sac deformity and also demonstrating pattern of
enhancement.
4. Heterogeneous signal is again redemonstrated in the bone
marrow, likely
consistent with a combination of osteomyelitis/discitis.
5. Persistent bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**11-2**] XR L-Spine:
Single intraoperative radiograph performed without a radiologist
present.
These demonstrate the lower lumbar spine. At the lumbosacral
junction,
instrumentation is demonstrated. Background degenerative change
is
demonstrated in the remainder of the lumbar spine in the single
intraoperative radiograph. For full details of surgery, please
consult the operative report.
.
[**11-9**] MRI SPINE:
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent multiloculated small epidural abscess anterior to
the thecal
sac at the L5-S1 level measuring up to 2 cm in the SI dimension
and
compressimg the thecal sac at this level.
2. Markedly improved epidural abscesses at C5 through T1, T3-T4
and
posteriorly at L4-L5. Fluid collections in the resection bed
within the
cervical and lumbar spine may be postoperative, though infection
cannot be
excluded.
3. Persistent multifocal abnormal bone marrow signal
abnormality, consistent
with extensive osteomyelitis.
4. Large bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**11-9**] right upper extremity ultrasound:
1. Fibrin sheath identified around PICC line in the right
basilic vein. The
fibrin sheath does not extend beyond the basilic vein.
2. No deep venous thrombosis identified in right upper limb.
.
[**11-12**] Ultrasound:
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler imaging of the common
femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins was performed
bilaterally. Normal
compressibility, flow, waveform, and augmentation demonstrated.
No
intraluminal thrombus is identified. Subcutaneous edema is noted
bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: No lower extremity deep venous thrombosis
bilaterally.




Brief Hospital Course:
#. MSSA infection (including epidural abscesses/vertebral
osteo/meningitis/bacteremia/skin lesions/UTI): Pt found to have
MSSA from blood and also grew MSSA from urine.  Vancomycin was
started, then switched to Nafcillin when the organism was
identified. TTE was performed and showed no vegetations. It is
unknown what the portal of entry for the MSSA was. The
bacteremia, skin lesions and UTI resolved with appropriate
antibiotic therapy. Ortho spine was consulted and recommended
serial imaging to determine whether epidural abscesses were
increasing in size or causing spinal cord compression. Pt got
MRIs approximately once a week and on the 3rd it was more clear
that the patient would require surgery. She underwent
neurosurgery [**10-30**] and for epidural abscess drainage (and C7
corpectomy, C4-T1 fusion, T3-4 laminectomy).  Multiple abscesses
present (~5, with 3 major ones), hardware place, cultures sent,
debrided.  Upon repeat imaging post operatively, MRI showed
expanding T-spine epidural abscess, so she then underwent L
spine decompression [**11-2**] with debridement.  Per ID, Gentamycin
was added to help with Nafcillin penetration for a 5-day course,
which was completed on [**11-6**]. Pt will continue on nafcillin for
at least 8 weeks and will follow up with spine and ID.  Her
tentative stop date for nafcillin is [**2187-12-29**], or it may be
stopped on [**12-14**] when she visits ID.  She has an appointment with
Spinal surgery on [**2186-12-27**].  she will need to have her staples
removed on [**2187-11-23**] in rehab with log role [**Last Name (LF) 10313**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Spine
surgery. She is to have weekly [**First Name3 (LF) **] draws faxed to the Infectious
Disease Physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
.
#Hospital Acquired Pneumonia: treated for HAP with vancomycin
and cefepime from [**11-11**] through [**11-18**].  Her nafcillin was
stopped during this treatment and was restarted on [**11-19**].
.
#. Altered mental status: The patient was initially minimally
responsive. This was thought to be secondary to meningitis as
well as the severity of her infection. This resolved
substantially with antibiotics. She did remain minimally
delerious throughout her stay (generally oriented x3 with
moments of confusion). MRI head was normal.
.
# Weakness: As pt's mental status improved and she became
cooperative with  neuro exam, it became clear that she had
diffuse weakness with some focality (especially R arm) with
sensation relatively intact. Neurology was consulted who felt
that some of the weakness could be [**12-25**] cord inflammation and so
pt recieved pulsed steroids early in her admission without
significant effect. Pt underwent EMG which showed a mixed
picture (see EMG report for full details). Pt did undergo
decompression on [**10-30**] and [**11-2**] but strength remained similar.
.
#. GI Bleed:  On [**2187-10-28**] pt developed melanotic stools and a
hematocrit drop from 24 to 20. IV PPI was continued and she
recieved 1U of prbcs and had an EGD which showed severe
ulcerations in stomach and duodenum most consistent with nsaid
use (pt did use ibuprofen at home). Per pt she had had a normal
colonoscopy at [**Hospital1 112**] 4 yrs ago and this was not repeated as an
inpt. Pt also reports h/o duodenal ulcers in the [**2147**]. An h
pylori was sent and was positive. Treatment of h pylori was
deferred in setting of nafcillin therapy and severe infection.
Pt was continued on PPI, eventually  transitioned to PO. Pt will
need 2 week course of amoxicillin and clarithromycin after her
nafcillin treatment is complete (nafcillin does not cover h
pylori.)
She should continue lansoprazole until her visit with the
Gastroenterologist in [**Month (only) 404**].
.
#. Persistent Sinus Tachycardia: Pt maintained HR of ~100
throughout her admission (~1 month). This was felt to most
likely be related to her severe underlying infection and
recurrent low grade fevers. Intravascular volume depletion was
also a likely contributor given pt's low albumin and anasarca
and clinical appearance of being dry (dry mouth, low JVP). PE
was considered, however, pt was on DVT ppx throughout admission
and EKG did not have any changes. Further, pt's oxygen
requirement was minimal to none and ultimately it was decided
that PE was highly unlikely. Also given her prolonged stay may
be a PE, though this is less likely.
.
#. Edema: Patient was noted to have anasarca and an albumin of
1.9. Pt was not diuresed aggressively as she appeared
intravascularly depleted and had minimal oxygen requirement. Her
edema improved upon discharge.
.
#. Anemia: Pt remained anemic throughout her stay. Perhaps she
has had ulcers for some time contributing to her anemia. Her
reticulocyte count was 6.7 arguing against marrow suppression as
the etiology, however, iron studies were consistent with anemia
of chronic disease. The transfusion goal was set at 22. She
recieved 2U of PRBCs throughout her stay.
.
#. Pain: Patient had severe back pain throughout her admission
that was ultimately treated with a fentanyl patch with small
boluses of IV morphine for breakthrough pain. A kanair bed was
also found to help with her pain.
.
#. Rash: On admission pt had 2 rashes. She had diffuse small
pustules which grew MSSA and resolved c antibiotics. She also
had, on the left back, a 4 x 3cm erythematous plaque with a
central brown / black, rough, necrotic area which was biopsied
by dermatology and showed "Focal necrotizing vasculitis in
mid-dermis with focal thrombosis, and ischemic necrosis of
epidermis and appendages" which dermatology felt was consistent
with a reactive process, rather than representing a primary
vasculitis, given the clinical scenerio.
.
#. Acute renal failure: Pt had [**Last Name (un) **] on admission, which resolved
c IVF.
.
#. Elevated transaminases: Pt had elevated LFTs on admission,
most likely from poor perfusion in the setting of dehydration or
billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS.  RUQ ultrasound
unremarkable. This was trended and resolved.
.
#. Thrombocytopenia: in combination with direct bilirubinemia
was concerning for consumptive process like TTP or DIC on
admission, however no chistocytes on smear.  Most likely due to
poor production in the setting of infection and resolved during
admission.
.
#. Nutrition: she failed speech and swallow on [**11-12**].  A
percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube was placed on [**11-15**] and tube
feeds continued.
.
# Electrolyte Abnormalities: Patient had persistent hypokalemia
and hypophosphatemia. Standing electrolyte orders were instilled
and should be continued in rehab until levels normalize. Also, a
Chem-10 should be checked every other day while taking these
medications.

#. Access: Patient has a PICC placed in the right arm on
[**2187-10-19**].

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
MSSA epidural abscesses, MSSA meningitis and vertebral
osteomyelitis and discitis, MSSA UTI, MSSA bacteremia, MSSA
diffuse skin pustules, profound weakness. dysphagia. anasarca.
duodenal and gastric ulcers complicated by bleeding.


Discharge Condition:
Vital signs stable. very weak legs and R arm more swollen than L
arm, but very diffuse weakness. anasarca. intermittently
confused.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a bacterial infection of your spinal
fluid and the bones of your spine as well as your urine and
blood and skin. You were treated with antibiotics and the
orthopedic surgeons did two surgeries to take out the abscesses.


You also had a lot of weakness, for which we had neurology see
you. They felt that your weakness was due to a combination of
factors including the infection around your spine and also some
muscle weakness from being so weak. You worked extensively with
physical therapy and will continue to do so at rehab.
.
You were having difficulty swallowing as well, thought secondary
to pharyngeal inflammation from your cervical spine surgery and
muscle weakness from prolonged hospitalization.  You therefore
had a gastrojejunostomy tube placed to receive nutrition.
.
You will need to wear the cervical collar until you meet with
the spine surgeons on [**2187-12-27**]. You have staples on
your back. These will need to be removed [**2187-11-23**]. We spoke with
the spine surgeons and they stated your facility can remove
these under log role precautions.
.
You will need to continue nafcillin until at least [**2187-12-28**],
unless the Infectious Disease specialists tell you otherwise at
your appointment on [**2187-12-14**].
