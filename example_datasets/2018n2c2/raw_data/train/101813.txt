History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 year old male who was transferred from an OSH on

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 77982**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 **] on [**2112-3-30**] after subtotal colectomy for LGIB requiring a
massive transfusion of 8u pRBC.

His [**Hospital 18**] hospital course is broken down by systems:

Neuro
He was intermittently sedated with fentanyl and propofol.  His
sedation was weaned to prn dilaudid and oxycodone liquid.  Pain
gradually became a nonissue.  He should not require pain
medication even for VAC changes.  He was seen by neurology for
dystonia, who recommended an MRI of the brain whcih showed an
acute left parietal subcortical infarct.  The neurologist felt
that coumadinizing him with a goal INR 2.5- 3.5 would be best to
prevent another stroke.  The etiology of his stoke is presumed
cardiac given his atrial fibrillation.  His cognition gradually
improved throughout his hospital course, as did his dystonia,
for which he is on cogentin per neurology.  At present, he is
alert and can communicate effectovely.

Cards
On admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 77982**] had afib with RVR for which he was on
an amiodarone gtt.  He was evaluated by cardiology and weaned
off amiodarone.  After amiodarone was weaned, his rhythm was
intermittently in and out of afib.  He eventually stabilized on
PO lopressor and PO amiodarone.  In addition, he was
intermittently on and off pressors, including levophed and
pitressin.  Eventually he stabilized and has been off of all
pressors for over 2 weeks prior to discharge.

Pulm
The patient had a tracheostomy.  He was gradually weaned on the
ventillator.  Eventually he was weaned to trach collar, which he
has been tolerating for over 2 weeks.  On [**5-4**], he did tolerate a
Passy-muir valve trial.  He requires supervision with the PM
valve, because he desaturates.  He does require suctioning
intermittently.

FEN/GI
Tube feeds via Dobhoff, TPN, ostomy, serial abdominal
debridements [**4-4**], [**4-8**], and abdominal VAC [**4-12**], 16, 17, 20, 24,
26 and Q 3 days thereafter.  Last VAC change was [**2112-5-8**].  His
abdominal wound has been healing very well with a VAC dressing.
It is granulating nicely.  There had been a fistulous connection
between the ostomy and the wound.  This has since closed off
after a few vicryl sutures were placed at the bedside.  He was
seen and evaluated by plastic surgery who recommended outpatient
skin grafting.  He has been tolerating tube feeds at goal for
over 2 weeks prior to discharge and his ostomy is productive.
He gets his tube feeds via a Dobhoff.  We did not feel that a
PEG was a good idea in him beacause of his anatomy.  He was
hypernatremic to 153 at a maximum, but he did respond to free
water boluses and his sodium has since stabilized.  We have
since decreased his free water boluses.

GU
He developed ARF and started hemodialysis at the referring
institution x3 days.  Daily CVVH was started at [**Hospital1 18**] via R fem
HD catheter, and he was weaned off CVVH, intermittently on
lasix, and he now makes appropriate urine output without any
assistance.  His azotemia gradually cleared.  Withing the past
week, we have started gradual diuresis to make him about a liter
negative daily.  His weights have been retruning to baseline of
98 kg.

H
Mr. [**Known lastname 77982**] was found to have small peripheral PEs and HIT at
the referring institution, and was continued on an argatroban
gtt.  Eventually he was transitioned off the argatroban to
coumadin.  He was found to be HIT negative by seratonin release
assay.  He is currently on coumadin, goal INR 2.5- 3.5.

ID
The patient had a long and complicated infectious disease
course.
Meropenem ([**4-16**]) and vancomycin ([**4-17**]) for MRSA PNA, fluconazole
for [**Female First Name (un) **] torulopsis in the urine and sputum [**4-19**], flagyl
empircally for C. diff (although he never tested positive) [**4-20**]
Cultures include
Klebsiella in blood at OSH
[**3-31**] Wound cx: [**Female First Name (un) **], klebs
[**4-3**] Sputum: budding yeast, GNR, MRSA
[**4-10**] Sputum: sparse klebs [**Last Name (un) 36**] to cipro/bactrim
[**4-14**] Sputum: MRSA, Klebs
[**4-17**] sputum: MRSA, 2+budding yeast, sparse GNR
[**4-20**] sputum: MRSA and 1+budding yeast

Eventually, all antiobiotics were stopped on [**2112-5-4**].

Endo
Mr. [**Known lastname 77982**] was kept on a strict insulin sliding scale to keep
his sugars within a tight range.
