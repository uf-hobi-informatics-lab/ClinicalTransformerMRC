Subclavian CVL

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 52**] is a 63-year-old woman with a history of recurrent
Burkitt's lymphoma D +15 of [**Hospital1 **], who was recently discharged
from [**Hospital1 18**] after her first treatment for recurrence (see PMH).
She had been doing well at home until the morning of [**2134-10-9**].
She had awoken early to come to her outpatient appointment at 7
[**Hospital 1826**] clinic, and on standing from bed, felt very
lightheaded. She does not recall much after that point. Her son
found her in the kitchen, lying against the cabinets in a pool
of feces. They called 911, and on transport to [**Hospital3 **], her BP was found to be 58/38. She was given IVF on
transport and in the ED at [**Hospital3 **].
.
She was afebrile, and her blood pressure responded to fluid
resuscitation to 90s/40s on transfer. She has been mentating the
entire time. At the OSH a chest X-Ray and Head CT were done.
Both of which were negative for any acute process. She was given
a dose of vancomycin and cefepime at the outside hospital out of
concern for infection given her neutropenia (WBC 0.2 at the OSH)
and hypotension.
.
On arrival to the floor, her vitals were T 99.4, BP 105/50, HR
99, RR 18 and O2 sat 100% on RA. She is mentating well and is
currently asymptomatic. She denies any fever or chills, cough,
chest pain, shortness of breath, dysuria, frequency, urgency,
myalgias, or abdominal pain. She admits to diarrhea this am,
lightheadedness, feeling "dry," and pain in her mouth.


Past Medical History:
Interval History:
Burkitt's Lymphoma: She was admitted [**2134-9-20**] with 6 weeks of
persistent, progressive shoulder pain. On admission, there was a

palpable mass on her right chest wall and axilla. A CT scan
showed a large axillary mass that was cocerning for recurrence
of disease. She had an IR guided biopsy [**9-22**] which was
inconclusive, and was then taken to the OR for surgical
excisional biopsy [**9-23**] that showed recurrence of disease. On
[**2134-9-25**] she had an echocardiogram and began treatment with
[**Hospital1 **]. She had an LP done on [**10-1**], which was positive for
disease. At that time she recieved intrathecal methotrexate and
hydrocort. On [**2134-10-5**] her LP was repeated and she recieved
intrathecal cytarabine.  She was discharged with neupogen for
one week with close follow-up.

Studies:
[**10-10**] CT ABD/PELVIS- 1. No infectious source identified in the
chest, abdomen or pelvis. 2. Interval decrease in size of
confluent right axillary adenopathy compared to [**2134-9-21**]. 3. Single stable left paraaortic lymph node. 4. Sigmoid
diverticulosis, without diverticulitis. 5. Distention of the
stomach, without evidence for mechanical obstruction.  Correlate
clinically.

[**11-6**] CT Chest: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute pulmonary embolism or aortic pathology.
2. Similar appearance of 1-cm ground-glass nodular opacity in
the right upper lobe. Recommend continued followup.
3. Sub-4mm pulmonary nodules, with questionable interval
increase in size,
could be re-evaluated when followup for the ground-glass
opacity.
4. Slightly interval decrease in size of the right axillary
lymph node
conglomerate.

[**11-8**] ECHO: IMPRESSION: Mild global hypokinesis. Mild mitral
regurgitation. No evidence of endocarditis seen. If clinically
suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography
does not exclude endocarditis. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2134-10-29**], the findings are similar.
Abnormal septal motion was seen on the prior study also.

[**11-14**] MRI shoulder: The lymphomatous mass in the right axilla,
encasing the right brachial plexus has increased in size
compared to prior imaging.

[**11-17**] U/S: No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.

[**11-18**] CT torso: read pending at time of discharge, will be
followed up at outpatient appt on Monday [**11-22**]


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 52**] is a 63-year-old woman with
recurrent Burkitt's lymphoma who is D+15 of [**Hospital1 **] admitted from
an OSH with hypotension and neutropenia after a syncopal episode
at home.
.
# Hypotension/Syncope: She was found to be hypotensive to 58/38
by EMS, which responded to fluids. She was fluid resuscitated to
SBP of 70s by EMS and SBP of 90's by OSH ED prior to transfer.
Blood cultures were drawn and she was given cefepime and vanco
and transferred to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**]. On arrival she was given 2L of
fluid, 1 unit of blood, and cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl.
Her pressures responded. OSH cultures came back as VRE 1:4
bottles, sensitive to ampicillin, daptomycin, levofloxacin, and
linezolid. She was switched to ampicillin on [**10-12**] and her PICC
was pulled. She was switched to daptomycin on Monday [**2134-10-18**]
because she had begun receiving hyper CVAD part B and amp
interferes with clearance of methotrexate.  She had a TTE and
TEE which showed no vegetations. As she was being treated for
the bacteremia, Ms. [**Known lastname 52**] again became hypotensive and
febrile, requiring transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she required
pressors. Blood cultures were sent and ultimately returned
positive with pseudomonas, believed to be associated with her
central line. Her line was pulled and her broad spectrum
antibiotic coverage (started given her sepsis in the setting of
neutropenia) was narrowed to cefepime, gentamicin, and
linezolid. Gentamicin was d/c-ed a few days after transfer to
the floor and linezolid was transitioned to ampicillin as the
patient was believed to have leukosuppression secondary to the
linezolid. She completed a 10 day course of antibiotics (amp and
cefepime) from the time her ANC was greater than 1000 per ID
recommendations and remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable
for the remainder of her hospital course.
.
# Burkitt's Lymphoma: She was admitted on day +15 of [**Hospital1 **]. An
LP with intrathecal chemotherapy was performed on [**2134-10-14**]. A
subclavian line was placed on [**10-15**] and treatment with hyper
CVAD part B was started on [**10-16**]. She tolerated her chemotherapy
well, complicated by mild mucositis and the bacteremia discussed
above. She had one more round of intrathecal chemotherapy with
cytarabine on [**11-4**]. LPs on [**11-18**], and [**11-11**] were negative
for malignant cells. Patient had significant right shoulder and
arm pain as well as right hand weakness, believed secondary to
brachial plexus involvement of her lymphoma. She underwent MRI
of her R shoulder which confirmed this finding and had 4
sessions of XRT as a palliative therapy. She had 4 LP's which
were negative for malignant cells. Had IT cytarabine on [**11-18**]
prior to discharge which she tolerated well. Pt had CT of torso
to evaluate for progression of disease, read at the time of
discharge was pending but will be followed up at follow-up
appointment Monday following discharge when pt will return for
chemotherapy gemcitabine and vinorelbine. Acyclovir and
fluconazole were held given elevated LFTs, will trend LFTs as
outpatient and do liver ultrasound if necessary. Pt was given
pentamidine prior to discharge for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
.
# Cardiomyopathy: Patient became tachycardic at the time of her
second episode of sepsis. This continued intermittently through
her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay and subsequently on the floor. Tachycardia was
sinus in nature, up into the 140s with movement, and was
attributed to an underlying cardiomyopathy (EF 45-50% on echo,
last on [**10-29**]). Cardiology was consulted for management and she
was started on metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] which she tolerated well.
.
# DVT: Found to have right upper extremity DVT last admission
and was on lovenox for that until she had a drop in platelets
(treatment related). She was thrombocytopenic during her
admission and her lovenox was held. An ultrasound of the arm was
repeated and was negative for clot.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Stable. Continued Levothyroxine 100mcg PO
daily
.
# Depression: Patient was frequently tearful and endorsed
saddened mood and symptoms of depression. Was started on
citalopram 10 mg daily.
