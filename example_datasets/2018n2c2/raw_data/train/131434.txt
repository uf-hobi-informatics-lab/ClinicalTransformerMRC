of PNA several years ago admitted recently with PNA treated with
PO levoflox but now re-presenting with fevers and fatigue. Per
patient he was in his USOH until Sunday when he developed severe
fatigue. He says this was how he felt with his last bout of PNA.
He had a dry cough but is not sure if he also had fevers because
he didnt have a thermometer. He was admitted here with a CAP and
treated with one dose of levofloxacin IV and then switched to PO
levofloxacin and sent home.
 Over the last few days he has not felt any better and every
time the tylenol wears off he feels even worse. Mostly he has
fatigue. The cough is non-productive but it does hurt him to
cough. He denies myalgias. He had one episode of diarrhea this
morning but otherwise no GI complaints although he has not been
able to drink or eat much. Today he was feeling even worse and
he took his temperature and it was 103 so he decided to come to
the Ed.

PNA. ECG was sinus tachycardia to 126bpm. 2L NS brought HR down

pcn allergy with hives he tolerated the ctx well.

Micro:  blood, sputum cultures . . .

Urine legionella negative
Cdiff . . .

Images:
POrtable CXR: RLL PNA

IMPRESSION:

1. Right lower lobar pneumonia with a small amount of adjacent
pleural
effusion. No large obstructing mass is seen, although
post-treatment imaging
can be considered if there is a concern for malignancy.

2. Nonspecific ground-glass opacity within the right upper lobe,
likely
reflecting mild inflammatory change.

3. Mild left atelectasis with a trace amount of pleural
effusion.

4. Small pericardial effusion.

5. Splenomegaly, incompletely imaged.


Brief Hospital Course:
# PNA: Failed PO levoquin and CURB65 score high enough to be
re-admitted. Likely had resistent bacterial PNA and needs Rx
with IV antibiotics for longer prior to switching to PO. He was
treated with Vanc/ctx/azithro and then switched to
vanc/meropenem/gent/azithro at the recommendations of ID when he
continued to have hypoxia and fevers. A CT showed no abscess or
fluid collection. He underwent bronchoscopy which revealed clear
airways but blood-tinged fluid on BAL. Blood, urine, and sputum
cultures had no growth. Urinary legionella was negative. His
antibiotics were eventually tailored to meropenem, gentamicin,
vancomycin prior to transfer out of MICU and doses increased
according to levels. His oxygenation requirements decreased and
he was transferred out of the MICU. He was treated with mucinex
and codeine as well as nebs PRN for symptom control. his final
antibiotic regimen was vanc to be continued for 5 more days,
gentamycin to be continued for two more days and ciprofloxacin
to be continued for 2 more days. He completed a course of
azithromycin as well as meropenem. PPD was negative.

#  Hyponatremia: likely [**1-28**] to either the PNA or dehydration
from poor po intake. Improved with IVF. Discharge sodium 138.

#  Renal Insufficiency: likely pre-renal [**1-28**] fever and
dehydration from poor po intake. Improved with IVR. Discharge
creatinine 0.8.

# Tachycardia: Likely [**1-28**] dehydration from fever and poor po
intake. Resolved with IVF.

# Diarrhea: likely [**1-28**] ADR from ABx but could be cdiff or [**1-28**]
legionella which would explain both the lung and GI findings.
Urinary legionella was negative and Cdiff negatiee as well.
Diarrhea resolved.

# CAD: Stable. ACE inhibitor and statin held in the setting of
acute illness. Restarted on time of discharge.

# GERD: Continued home nexium
# Code: confirmed full
# Emergency Contact:  wife: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76344**]
