Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6346**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from Outside Hospital with sepsis and bowel leakage
after two laparotomies

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy, extensive lysis of adhesions, small
bowel resection with enteroenterostomy, cecal primary closure,
abdomen washout and gastrojejunostomy tube placement.


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 17**] is a 52-year-old female who was transferred from an
outside hospital after being admitted inearly [**Month (only) 205**] with
diverticulitis. The patient was treated withantibiotic therapy
and then underwent exploratory laparotomy
and segmental colectomy with primary anastomosis on [**2156-6-30**]. She spent 10 days in the hospital postoperatively and
was discharged home. She returned shortly thereafter with
increasing abdominal pain and fevers. The patient had a
pelvic abscess with an anastomotic leak and was taken to the
operating room a second time on [**2156-7-20**] for
exploratory laparotomy and abscess drainage. Enterotomies
were made during this exploration and they were repaired with
interrupted silk sutures. The patient was given an end
colostomy and mucous fistula.

Postoperatively on [**2156-7-26**], succus was actively drainging
from the wound. A CT scan was performed which showed
extravasation of contrast from the bowel into the pelvis and out
the wound. The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for tertiary care after that finding.
The patient was initially accepted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
then transferred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] on the Blue Surgery service.

The patient was seen in the surgical intensive care unit in
on arrival. There was bilious drainage from the abdominal
incision and feculent drainage from [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain
that had been placed in the pelvis by the previous surgeon.
The patient was explained the risks and benefits of operative
procedure and it was deemed appropriate to operate as there
was significant drainage and it probably would not be
controlled adequately with nonoperative therapy. The grave
situation was explained to the patient and the patient's
daughter, and the patient agreed to proceed and signed a
surgical consent for exploration. Bowel resection, diverting
ostomy and requirement to leave the abdomen open were all
discussed and a consent was signed.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Blue surgery service and
underwent an emergent operation on [**2156-7-27**] (see Dr.[**Name (NI) 11471**] op
note). Postoperatively, her wound healed secondarily with wet to
dry dressing changes twice daily. She underwent CT-guided
drainage of a pelvic abscess with placement of a pigtail
catheter. A G tube and JP drain were also placed. She was
administered antibiotics for organisms isolated from her wound
cultures. One week [**Last Name (LF) **], [**Known firstname 17**] developed a fever/rash and
renal failure thought to be a reaction to an antibiotic, most
likely Zosyn. She also developed a severe skin rash and was
briefly transferred to the SICU for fluid resuscitation. She
recovered from the drug reaction, was transferred back to the
floor. Repeat CT scans of her abdomen showed no new collections,
and she continued to improve. The JP drain was removed on [**8-31**].
She was deemed ready for discharge to rehab on [**9-3**].
