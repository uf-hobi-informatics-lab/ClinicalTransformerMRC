History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83237**] is an 88 yo RH woman with a pMH remarkable for HTN,
CHF and LBD on coumadin (parox AF) p/w a fall 24h prior to
admission at [**Hospital1 18**].

She fell from her rocking chair and struck the LEFT side of her
head and LEFT hand yesterday at noon. She did not loose her
consciousness (as per nurse who saw her in her chair 1 minute
prior to falling). She is usually having falls when attempting
to
walk with her walker. She did have a bilateral hip replacement
and a subsequent LEFT femoral fracture (with residual internal
hip rotation) that impairs her gait (for 2 years).

She remained in the [**Hospital3 **] facility, but started to
become confused. She was taken to [**Hospital3 4107**] today at
around
11:00 am, where she received a CT scan that showed a small (1.
3cm) left frontal intraparenchimal bleed without a midline
shift,
not open to the ventricles, no data of hydrocephalus. At [**Hospital1 **]
her VS were stable. At the time she was confused.  She had an
INR
of 2.97 and received vitamin K 10 mg iv without complications.

Once at [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her VS were  98.6F, 70 bpm, 161/ 71, 16RR, So2
100% in RA. She was alert and oriented *3. Pleasant and
cooperative with the ED team. She received FFP and a new CT CNS
and C-spine scan w/o contrast that showed.

The family denies any previous episodes with focal deficits
eventually resolving. Sh ehas been having viual hallucinations
for 24 months. Those are well formed (people). She talks to
them,
but they do not reply. She has been seeing her husband lately
(he
passed the way 6 months ago).
