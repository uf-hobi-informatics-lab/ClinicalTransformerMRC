HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49-year-old
male who is well known to the Transplant Surgery Service who
was diagnosed in [**2170**] when he presented with acute upper
gastrointestinal bleed secondary to esophageal varices which
were banded.

The patient was diagnosed with hepatitis C and found on liver
biopsy to have cirrhosis and underwent URO treatment with
PEG-interferon and ribavirin.  The patient's evaluation also
demonstrated a less than 5 cm lesion in the liver for which
he had radiofrequency ablation therapy, and then the patient
was listed for transplant.

On presentation, the patient denied chest pain or shortness
of breath.  Denied a history of diabetes, coronary artery
disease, pulmonary or renal issues.  The patient had a good
appetite and approximately a 25-pound weight gain.  The
patient complained of pruritus, dark urine, and loose stools.

ablation of a right lobe lesion, less than 5 cm.
 5.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to varices;
status post multiple bandings.

of greater than 55%.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to the Transplant Surgery Service.  The patient was kept
nothing by mouth and was consented for a liver transplant.

The patient had the operation on the day after admission.
The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day one, the patient remained afebrile with
stable vital signs.  The patient received morphine as needed
for pain.  The patient was continued on Unasyn, Bactrim,
fluconazole, and ganciclovir and was put on CellCept and
Solu-Medrol for immunosuppression.

On postoperative day two, the patient had no acute
complaints.  The patient was stable.  The patient continued
to be nothing by mouth with a nasogastric tube in place.  The
patient had a Foley and was doing well.  The patient's right
internal jugular cordis was changed over wire to triple lumen
catheter without any difficulties, and the patient was
extubated.

The patient's issues on postoperative day three were
bradycardia and the patient was hypertensive, most likely due
to the increase in the patient's volume from the surgery.
The patient was still intubated and kept nothing by mouth
with intravenous fluids.  The patient was given Lasix for
diuresis.  The patient's perioperative antibiotics were
discontinued, and he was Heplocked.  The patient was
transferred to the floor.

On postoperative day four, the patient was complaining of
some pain at the incision site on the back.  The patient
remained afebrile and continued to be somewhat hypertensive.
The patient was advanced to a regular diet as tolerated.  The
patient was also on ............ of 1 gram [**Hospital1 **] and
prednisone, and Neoral for immunosuppression.

On postoperative day five, the patient had no complaints.  He
remained afebrile.  He continued to be somewhat hypertensive.
The patient was continued on a prednisone taper.  The
patient's Foley was removed and Heplocked.  He was encouraged
to be out of bed and ambulate.

On postoperative day six, the patient remained afebrile and
somewhat hypertensive.  With elevated blood sugars we
obtained [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consultation to monitor the patient's
sugars, and the patient was continued on a prednisone taper,
and CellCept, and Neoral.

On postoperative day seven, the patient had no complaints.
The patient was doing well.  The patient continued to be out
of bed with ambulation.  He was taking good oral intake.

On postoperative day eight, the patient was doing well.  He
remained afebrile with stable vital signs.  The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were both removed without any
difficulties.  However, the patient's liver function tests
were elevated from the previous day.  Obtained a liver biopsy
which showed mild to severe rejection, focal acute
cholangitis and focal lobular neutrophilic aggregates and
mild ............ perfusion injury.  The patient was promptly
put on Solu-Medrol 500 mg intravenously times three to treat
the acute cellular rejection.

On postoperative day number nine, the patient had no
complaints.  He remained afebrile with stable vital signs. He
was doing well on the high-dose steroids.  The patient's
blood sugars were well controlled, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] input.

On postoperative day ten, the patient completed his last dose
of Solu-Medrol and was put on a by mouth form of steroid
taper.  The patient's liver function tests had improved on
the Solu-Medrol and continued to do well from that aspect.
