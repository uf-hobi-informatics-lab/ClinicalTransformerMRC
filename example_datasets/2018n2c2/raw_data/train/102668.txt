Chief Complaint:
Fall and increased weight gain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2120-7-12**] Cardiac catheterization
[**2120-7-14**] Pulmonary arterial catheterization
[**2120-7-14**] Intra-aortic balloon pump insertion
[**2120-7-15**] Dialysis catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
68 year old man with a history of coronary disease status post
cabg in [**2107**] and multiple PCIs since then presenting on the [**7-7**]
with weight gain at home and altered mental status resulting in
a fall at home. In the ED he had a possible seizure with
dilantin loading. He became hypotensive after that and went to
MICU. He was then sent to the medicine service for several days
working up neurologic issues and falls. Then the patient began
having chest pain, echo showed new acute decrease in the EF from
45->20% and some apical and septal akinesis. Cath showed severe
native disease with 2 BMS placed in RCA. RHC showed elevated
wedge at 30mmHg. RA pressures 25 and PAP 73. CI 1.5. Then
transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] for further management.
.
Patient was given 80mg IV lasix given last night and this
morning still volume overloaded and given another 100mg IV lasix
and metolazone and lasix gtt. Team is concerned for poor forward
flow given LFTs have increased to >1000, creatinine to 3.3, INR
>2, and only 600mL UOP with 20mg/hr lasix gtt yesterday.
.
At this point, he was transferred to the HF service and admitted
to the CCU for inotropes, swan, and lasix drip. If
non-responsive to this will need IABP.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient appears somewhat lethargic and
uncomfortable but is conversant.  He endorses discomfort around
his foley site but denies cough, chest pain, sob, abdominal
symptoms, fevers/chills.

STUDIES:
[**2120-7-6**] CT Head w/o contrast- No acute intracranial process
[**2120-7-6**] C Spine w/o contrast- No acute fractures or
malalignment
[**2120-7-6**] CXR Portable AP- Midline sternotomy wires are again
noted.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted with probable
basilar atelectasis.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Heart size is
top
normal.  No pneumothorax. IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural
effusions with basilar atelectasis.
[**2120-7-6**] CT Abd/Pelvis-IMPRESSION: 1.  Nonspecific mesenteric
stranding and small amount of fluid in the abdomen could be
secondary to generalized third spacing. 2.  Chronic loculated
left sided pleural fluid collection/chronic empyema is stable.
3.  Gallstones and sludge within the gallbladder.
[**2120-7-8**] EEG- This is an abnormal waking EEG because of diffuse
polymorphic arrhythmic theta and delta activity. This background
activity improves to theta range activity on stimulation. These
findings are suggestive of moderate encephalopathy but of
nonspecific cause. There are no epileptiform discharges or focal
abnormalities seen.
[**2120-7-10**] MRI Head w and w/o contrast- 1.  No acute intracranial
abnormality. 2.  No pathologic focus of enhancement or anatomic
substrate for seizure. 3.  Relatively mild global atrophy.
4.  Chronic inflammatory changes in the paranasal sinuses;
correlate clinically.
.
[**2120-7-11**] Portable TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the septum and apex; the rest of the
left ventricle appears hypokinetic with regional variation. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The study is
inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the findings of the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-5-19**], left ventricular
systolic function is significantly further compromised.
.
[**2120-7-12**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated three vessel
disease in the right dominant system The LMCA had a patent stent
with mild in stent restenosis, there was a 30-40% distal LMCA
stenosis beyond the distal edge of the LMCA stent which was
unchanged from prior. The LAD had diffuse severe disease
proximally and occludes at the mid vessel after a tiny diagonal
branch. The Cx had diffuse disease throughout with serial focal
50% stenoses. The RCA had an ostial 80% stenosis which was
heavily calcified. There was also an 80% heavily calcified 80%
stenosis in the mid RCA. Diffuse mild to moderate disease was
seen throughout the rest of the RCA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left
sided filling pressure with an RVEDP of 24 mmHg and an LVEDP of
26 mmHg. There was pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of
73/35 mmHg. The cardiac index was depressed at 1.55 L/min/m2.
The central aortic pressure was 120/73 mmHg. Upon careful
pullback of a pigtail catheter from the LV to the aorta no
pressure gradient was seen.
3. Arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent LIMA which
supplied a diffusely diseased LAD. The SVGs were not engaged as
they were known to be occluded.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with a
3.5x26mm INTEGRITY stent which was postdilated proximally to
4.0mm. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA
comments).
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid RCA with a 3.5x12mm
INTEGRITY stent which was postdilated to 3.5mm. Final
angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically
apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA comments).
6. Successful closure of the 6 French right femoral arteriotomy
site with a 6 French ANGIOSEAL VIP device with good resultant
hemostasis.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate to severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with a BMS.
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid RCA with a BMS.
6. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with
an Angioseal device.
.
[**2120-7-15**] EEG:
Abnormal EEG due to a low voltage slow background throughout.
This indicates a widespread encephalopathy. Medications,
metabolic disturbances, and infection are the most common
causes. Ischemia or hypoxia are other possibilities. There were
no areas of prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may
obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform features or
electrographic seizures.
.
[**2120-7-15**] CT abdomen & pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic hematoma detected.
2.  Circulatory assist device within the abdominal aorta.
3.  Persistent bilateral nephrograms, compatible with severe
renal failure, as the last contrast-enhanced study was performed
on [**2120-7-10**].
4.  Unchanged small left pleural effusion.
.
[**2120-7-19**] Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior,
and inferolateral walls and distal anterior, lateral and apical
walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 25-30
%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive
regional systolic dysfunction most c/w multivessel CAD
(including proximal RCA). Right ventricular cavity enlargement.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-7-11**],
global left ventricular systolic function is slightly improved.
.
[**2120-7-20**] KUB:
1) No dilated loops of large or small bowel to suggest
obstruction or ileus. No obvious free air identified.
2) Multiple clustered locules of air in the right mid abdomen
may represent stool within the colon in an area of prior surgery
and are similar to the appearance on the [**2120-7-7**] abdominal CT.
However, the differential diagnosis for this appearance includes
air within an abscess.  If there is significant clinical
suspicion for intra-abdominal infection, then this area could be
further assessed with a CT scan.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: 68 year old man with a history of coronary
disease status post cabg in [**2107**] and multiple PCIs, DM type II,
hypertension and depression who presented initially on [**2120-7-7**]
with weight gain at home and altered mental status.  He had what
appeared to be a possible seizure in the ED, resulting in
dilantin loading and subsequent hypotension requiring transfer
to the MICU. He was then sent to the medicine service for
several days while work up continued on his neurologic issues
and falls (work up negative). Then on [**2120-7-11**], he began having
chest pain, and echo showed new acute decrease in the EF from
45->20% with some apical and septal akinesis. Cath the following
day showed severe native disease with 2 BMS placed in RCA, and
RHC showed elevated wedge at 30mmHg. He was intitially
transferred back to the cardiology service for management,
however he became increasingly volume overloaded with end organ
dysfunction (renal and liver failure) suggestive of cardiogenic
shock, necessitating transfer to the CCU under the heart failure
service.
.
CCU Course:  On arrival patient was started on inotropes,
pulmonary artery catheter was placed, and intra-aortic balloon
pump was initiated for support for his cardiogenic shock.  Given
his renal failure, CVVH was initiated (mostly for
ultrafiltration).  Despite full support with intermittent
pressors, IABP, and CVVH, he failed to improve.  On [**2120-7-17**], he
self-discontinued his balloon pump, leading to rapid
decompensation necessitating urgent intubation and transfer to
the cath lab for IABP re-placement.  He was able to wean off the
balloon pump on [**2120-7-19**], however his hemodynamics then worsened
again, necessitating the use of pressors.  Despite full pressor
support, his status continued to worsen.  Upon frank discussion
with his family regarding his grim prognosis, they felt that he
would never want to continue with aggressive care if there was
little chance of full recovery.  On [**2120-7-21**], they decided to
transition his care to comfort measures only.  He died
peacefully on [**2120-7-22**].
.
Please see below for details on each of his major active issues:
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# [**Date Range 7792**]/Cardiogenic Shock: On [**2120-7-11**] while on medicine
service, experienced chest pain with troponin of 0.1, negative
MB, but echo with new anterior WMA and EF depressed at 25% (down
from 40-45%).  Cath on [**7-12**] showed 80% ostial stenosis of the
RCA, which was stented with 2 bare metal stents.  Following the
cath, he continued to decompensate.  He appeared to be in
decompensated CHF by renal status, crackles on exam, and mild
peripheral edema.  A TTE showed an EF of 20% from baseline of
40-45% in 6/[**2118**].  He had 2 BMS placed to his RCA, his LVEDP was
elevatd at 30, pulmonary pressures were also elevated so the
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service. Despite aggresive
diuresis, patient continued to [**Last Name (un) 22977**] clinically, with high
filling pressures, low CI, low UOP and was transfered to CCU.
Patient was started on dobutamine for inotropic effect (could
not do milranone because of [**Last Name (un) **]). He was also on lasix drip.
Patient had an intra-aortic baloon pump to improve systemic
perfusion and coronary artery perfusion.
.
While in CCU a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to monitor CO.
Dobutamine drip was started in setting of low CO. The patient
was also started on CVVH to remove fluid thought to be
contributing to decreased CO as renal failure persisted. On [**7-17**]
pt was increasingly delusional and removed his IABP partially.
Decision was made to remove pump at this time and heparin ggt
d/c and pressure held at site. The patient's o2 sats decreased
at this time and lactate increased to over 6. Decision was made
to intubate and transfer to cath lab for replacement of pump.
Ballon pump was weaned off of IABP on [**7-19**]. Howver he conintued
to have high pressor requirements.
.
#.Acute on Chronic [**Last Name (un) **]: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.5, on
admission 2.2.  However after the drop in his blood pressure and
after his cath his Cr continued to rise and he stopped making
urine.  Renal was consulted who started CCVH to remove fluid to
help relieve strain on his heart.  CCVH was stopped when patient
was made CMO by family on [**7-21**].
.
#Transaminitis - On transfer to [**Hospital1 1516**] service, patients LFTs had
noted to increase to ALT 117, AST 418.  The day following cath,
his LFTs sharply rose to ALT 1200 and AST 1059, LDH 1900, TBili
1.9.  Concern was for shock liver vs med effect, Hepatology was
consulted who felt this was due to shock liver - they rec'd to
hold atorvastatin, obtain RUQ U/S which showed possibly fatty
liver with patent vasculature.  The following day, he developed
encephalopathy and lactulose was started. LFTs trended down
throughout his hospital course.
.
#.Fall at Home- His initial insult was a well-described
mechanical fall from slipping on mineral oil, and he did not
endorse symptoms consistent with vasovagal syncope. We also
considered orthostasis given history of same vs. arrhythmia vs.
seizure given possible seizure in CT scan. Patient was not found
to be orthostatic. Neurology consulted and had a low suspicion
of seizure. MRI with and without contrast was unremarkable.
Neurology continued to follow and did not recommend AED's.
.
IDDM: Patient was kep on insulin sliding scale and hi blood
surgars well well ontrolled in the CCU.
.
Goals of Care dicussion: On [**7-21**]: Family meeting was held with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]??????[**Doctor Last Name **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4402**], SW [**Doctor First Name **], and patient??????s family
including:  wife [**Name (NI) **], daughter [**Name (NI) 12983**], daughter [**Name (NI) 22978**], and
sister [**Name (NI) **].  They were updated on the patient??????s grim
prognosis and his continued decline despite maximal support.
The family was in agreement that per past discussions they had
with the patient, he would not have wanted a prolonged death and
would rather be made comfortable at this juncture.  In light of
this, Mr [**Known lastname **]??????s goal of care was focused on comfort only, with
cessation of all supportive measures including pressors, CVVH,
and the ventilator. After withdawal of all care he passed away
on [**2120-7-22**] at 7:10am.
