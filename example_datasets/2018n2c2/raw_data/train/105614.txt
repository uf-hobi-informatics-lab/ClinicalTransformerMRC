Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
infected PPM

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
lead and pacemaker extraction
Temporary pacer
Pacer insertion left chest


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is an 82-yo man with complete heart block s/p dual
chamber [**Company **] pacemaker [**10/2101**] with RV lead revision [**2-/2112**]
and recent device infection in [**1-/2113**], hypertension,
dyslipidemia, GERD, and BPH, who presented today with continued
device infection for lead and device extraction. The procedure
was prolonged due to significant fibrosis of the pacer leads,
and he was noted to have purulent material that was extracted
and sent to the microbiology lab for analysis. Given his history
of complete heart block and hypotension with his ventricular
escape rhythm, a temporary screw-in external pacemaker was
placed in the right IJ. Intra-operative TEE was unremarkable,
but he did require Neosynephrine in the OR for hypotension that
was thought to be due to the prolonged anesthesia. Given the
significant infection, the wound was left open, to close by
secondary intention, with plan to treat with IV antibiotics over
the weekend and re-implant a pacemaker next week.
.
With regards to the recent device infection in [**2113-1-12**],
this was initially treated with IV vancomycin, but that was
discontinued due to development of fever and rash. He was
instead treated with a full course of IV linezolid. The site was
noted to have significantly improved, and he was seen in [**Hospital **]
clinic at the end of [**Month (only) 404**] at which point the site was
considered to be healed. Per the patient, the site was stable
for over 3 months, but he then developed a new area of erythema
over the left lateral aspect of the pocket, with blistering. He
was seen for this complaint in [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2113-6-7**]. He denies
any fevers or chills but has been experiencing pain at the
pacemaker site with his usual activity. His WBC was 5.1 with a
normal differential on [**2113-6-12**], and he was admitted today for
lead and device extraction for continued infection versus new
pocket site infection.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was hypotensive with SBP in
the 60s. He received a 200cc NS IVF bolus with improvement to
the 90s. He complains of left-sided chest pain as well as pain
and tingling in his fingers bilaterally, left worse than right.
There is no weakness or numbness of the hands. The pains are
intermittent. ECG showed V-pacing at 60 bpm. STAT TTE showed no
obvious effusion or depressed ventricular function, and STAT CXR
was also unremarkable. His external pacemaker rate was increased
from 60 to 80 bpm. IV Linezolid was started for possible
septicemia. He did not require any further IVF or vasopressor
support.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Blood Cx [**6-16**] and [**6-17**] NGTD

ECHO [**6-15**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 - 40 %). The
right ventricle displays mild to m oderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
leaflets and pulmonic leaflets are not well seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results in the operating room at the
time of the study.

After lead extraction, there were no significant changes and no
signs of an enlarging pericardial effusion.

ECHO [**6-15**]
There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is very small. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is no pericardial
effusion.

CXR: [**2113-6-20**]
Since yesterday, right-sided dual-chamber pacemaker still ends
in expected
position. There is no pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural
effusion
increased, still tiny. Hyperinflation is unchanged. The
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. There is no other change.

ECG:
Baseline artifact. Sinus or atrial paced or ventricular paced
rhythm.
Since the previous tracing of [**2113-1-23**] atrial pacing is probably
new at a faster
rate.


Brief Hospital Course:
82-yo man with complete heart block s/p dual chamber pacemaker
with RV lead revision and recent device infection who presented
with continued device infection for lead and device extraction,
found to have significant infection of the pacer pocket and lead
fibrosis, now s/p external temporary pacemaker placement and
awaiting treatment with IV antibiotics prior to re-implantation
of permanent pacemaker.
.
# Infected pacemaker - He was seen for this complaint in [**Hospital **]
clinic on [**2113-6-7**]. He denies any fevers or chills but has been
experiencing pain at the pacemaker site with his usual activity.
His WBC was 5.1 with a normal differential on [**2113-6-12**], and he was
admitted on [**6-15**] for lead and device extraction. On arrival to
the CCU, the patient was hypotensive with SBP in the 60s. He
received a 200cc NS IVF bolus with improvement to the 90s. He
complained of left-sided chest pain as well as pain and tingling
in his fingers bilaterally, left worse than right. There is no
weakness or numbness of the hands. The pains are intermittent.
ECG showed V-pacing at 60 bpm. STAT TTE showed no obvious
effusion or depressed ventricular function, CXR was also
unremarkable. His external pacemaker rate was increased from 60
to 80 bpm. He was started on IV Linezolid. He did not require
any further IVF or vasopressor support.  The patient underwent
pacer and lead extraction on [**2113-6-15**] without complication. A
temporary pacer was also placed after removal.  The patient
remained stable and blood cx were NGTD.  He was seen by ID who
recommended 2 weeks of linezolid from pacer extraction [**2113-6-15**].
The patient had a new pacemaker placed on [**2113-6-19**] without
complication.  CXR showed no PTX and leads in proper position.
His wound culture eventually grew coag-neg staph.  The patient
will have both ID and EP follow-up with weekly labs.   The
patient remained afebrile and pacemaker was working properly.

# complete heart block (rhythm) - See above for management of
pacemaker. The patient had his lead and pacer extracted on
[**2113-6-15**]. A temporary external pacemaker in right IJ was placed.
He was monitored on tele. A new pacemaker was placed on [**2113-6-19**]
without complication.

# coronaries - The patient has no known CAD or findings of CAD
on ECG.  He remained chest pain free. He was continued on home
ASA.
.
# pump - The patient had an intra-op EF 35-40% with moderate
global LV hypokinesis. He remained clinically euvolemic.

# hypertension - The patient's anti-hypertensives were intially
held secondary to his hypotension.  Once his pressures had
stabilzed he was restarted on lisinopril 10mg and home
metoprolol succinate 12.5mg at the time of discharge.

# dyslipidemia - stable, continued home statin
.
# diabetes - stable, continued home Actos and ISS. He was also
continued on a diabetic diet.

# GERD - stable, continued home H2B

# BPH - His flomax was initally held secondary to hypotension,
but restarted once stable.
