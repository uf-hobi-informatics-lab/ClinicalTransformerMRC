STUDIES:
[**11-15**] CTA Chest/Abd/Pelvis:
1. Right upper lobe ground-glass parenchymal opacity, suggestive
of
pneumonia. Multifocal coalescent ground-glass nodules,
predominating upper
lobes but also present in left lower lobe, raise question of
metastatic
involvement. Moderate right pleural effusion.

2. Massive conglomerate aortocaval mass with central areas of
necrosis, which compresses the IVC, right common and external
iliac veins, and likely also right proximal ureter. Extensive
mediastinal, hilar, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and iliac
lymphadenopathy and massive splenomegaly. Overall picture
suggestive of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease.

3. Mildly prominent common bile duct. Please correlate with
liver function
test.

4. Diffuse gallbladder mural edema, likely related to systemic
disease,
unlikely due to cholecystitis.

5. Multiple left renal lesions are incompletely evaluated,
including a 12-mm interpolar left renal lesion (3, 301), which
could be further characterized by ultrasound.

[**11-15**] CT Head- 1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect. 2. Although there is no CT evidence of large
intracranial mass, MRI with gadolinium is superior in evaluation
of such lesions and can be considered if not contraindicated.

[**11-15**] LENI- No evidence of right lower extremity deep venous
thrombosis.

[**11-15**] EKG: ST at 108 bpm, no other acute changes

[**11-18**] Trans thoracic Echo- The left atrium is normal in size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

[**11-25**] Renal U/S: 1. No evidence of hydronephrosis, with
resolution of the mild hydronephrosis seen on CT [**2137-11-15**]. 2.
Nonvisualization of left renal interpolar region indeterminate
lesion seen on CT scan [**2137-11-15**], due to limited visualization.
For further evaluation,if clinically relevant, an MR could be
performed.

[**12-3**] CXR: The heart size remains normal and no typical
configurational abnormalities is seen. Thoracic aorta, stable
and within normal limits. Position of previously described left
subclavian approach advanced central venous catheter remains
unchanged terminating overlying the SVC at the level of the
carina.  No pneumothorax is seen. In comparison with the next
preceding portable examination, the findings have cleared up
markedly. In particular the basal bilateral densities strongly
suggestive of bilateral pleural effusions as seen on [**2137-11-21**], have now practically cleared completely, as both lateral
and posterior pleural sinuses are free with the patient in
upright position. Also, the parenchymal densities have
regressed; however, significant residuals remain on both sides.
These consist of lateral located hazy parenchymal densities
close to the pleural space at the level of the third and fourth
rib. On the left side these parenchymal densities are also in
peripheral location but somewhat higher up and overlying the
second and third ribs including the corresponding interspace. In
comparison with the preceding single view examination, it is
possible that these parenchymal densities have progressed
slightly and thus, further followup chest examinations in this
patient with history of lymphoma is recommended.

[**12-4**] CT Chest: 1. Widespread peripheral consolidations which
are new or increasing. These are not entirely specific, but the
striking peripheral character of consolidations is very
suggestive of an inflammator etiology such as eosinophilic
pneumonia or organizing pneumonia, either of which could be
associated with a drug reaction. The appearance would be much
less typical for an infectious etiology or progression of
lymphoma, which has apparently responded overall very well to
treatment.

2. New mild extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation of uncertain
significance. Correlation with liver function tests is
recommended. If the apppearance may be clinically significant
based on laboratory data or clinical presentation, then MRCP
could be considered or follow-up CT or ultrasound. Extrinsic
compression by lymphadenopathy that is not imaged on this study
is a possible, though somewhat unusual, possibility.

[**12-4**] CT Head: 1. No evidence of intracranial metastatic
disease. MR (if feasible) would be more sensitive than CT for
detection of metastatic lesions. 2. No acute intracranial
process.

[**12-9**] CXR: Heart size is normal. Mediastinal position, contour,
and width are unremarkable and stable. The abnormalities
demonstrated on prior chest
radiograph and chest CT appears to be grossly unchanged except
for may be
minimal progression at the level of the left lower lobe and
right upper
superficial area as well as interval development of minimal
amount of pleural effusion on the right. The finding continues
to be nonspecific with the differential diagnosis being broad
including eosinophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing
pneumonia, drug reaction, and less likely infection.

PATHOLOGY:
[**11-17**] Bone marrow biopsy- MARKEDLY HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH
EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY A LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER, MOST
CONSISTENT WITH DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA.

[**11-17**] R axillary lymph node biopsy- DIFFUSE LARGE B CELL
LYMPHOMA, HIGH GRADE.

[**11-17**] Immunophenotyping Flow Cytometry: Immunophenotypic finding
consistent with involvement by a kappa-restricted B-cell
lymphoproliferative disorder.  Correlation with concurrent bone
marrow biopsy (S10-48307G) is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT:
74 year old male with BPH, s/p R inguinal hernia repair present
with pleuritic abdominal/chest pain found to have a extensive
lymphadenopathy throughout torso and aotocaval large
conglomerate mass with compression of IVC and R common iliac
vein.
.
# Lymphoma- Patient was initially admitted to the medical floor
for expedited evaluation of presumed lymhoproliferative disorder
in the setting of CTA which showed bulky lymphadenopathy and
aortocaval large conglomerate mass with
compression of IVC and right common iliac vein. Initial labs in
the ED were remarkable for lactic acidosis with HCO3 of 15 and a
lactate of 7.9. On the medical floor, he was found to have a
uric acid of 13.5 and an LDH of 604 in the setting of normal
calcium/ phosphate/ potassium. He was started on allopurinol and
IVF due to concern for TLS. A heme-onc consult was called and an
axillary LN biopsy showed prelimary path c/w aggressive
lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy eventually showed diffuse large B
cell lymphoma. Patient was noted to have increased work of
breathing with ABG showing worsening acidosis 7.32/19/111 and
lactate of 11.4. A bicarb drip was initiated and due to concern
for worsening lactic acidosis, patient was transferred to the
ICU. Lactic acidosis was attributed to tumor mass necrosis vs.
infection and patient was started on vanc/zosyn/azithro for
pneumonia visualized on CT chest (see below). He received [**Hospital1 **]
for treatment of his lymphoma and tumor lysis labs were
monitored q6 given his spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome on
admission. He received rasburicase for persistently elevated
uric acid and new renal failure (creatinine 1.3 from 1.0) with
improvement of his symptoms. He became fluid overloaded and was
diuresed with lasix. He was called out to the floor where he
received a round of RCHOP with good effect and no subsequent
tumor lysis. He had some mucositis which was managed with pain
medications and mouth care. He was discharged home on D5 RCHOP
with follow up scheduled in the 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] outpatient clinic and
a plan to establish care in NY with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25139**]
(appointment tentatively scheduled for [**12-24**]).

# Pneumonia- Patient had chest CT with ground-glass parenchymal
opacity, suggestive of pneumonia. He was started on
vanco/zosyn/azithro and was continued on these antibiotics for 7
days after he was no longer neutropenic per pulmonary
recommendations. Repeat imaging with CT scan showed widespread
peripheral consolidations concerning for an inflammatory
etiology such as eosinophilic pneumonia or organizing pneumonia,
but ultimately attributed to resolving pneumonia in the setting
of a reconstituted immune system as the patient was asymptomatic
and appeared well. Patient will need repeat imaging in [**12-22**] weeks
after discharge to assess progression.
.
# Rash- Patient developed an erythematous papular eruption on
his back as well as a well demarcated erythematous plaque on his
lower L back. Dermatology was consult and attributed the former
to a resolving drug reaction and that latter to a contact
dermatitis. Triamcinolone was applied topically to the plaque
with gradual improvement.
.
#. Fluid retention: Patient received fluids as part of his
chemotherapy regimen. His weight increased 10 lbs over several
days secondary to fluid retention. He was diuresed with good
effect and subsequently reaccumulated fluid in his legs with the
second round of chemo. He was restarted on lasix and sent home
to continue diuresis with f/u in the outpatient clinic.
.
#. Headache: Patient complained of mild intermittent R
retro-orbital pain without associated visual changes, diploplia,
or floaters. Was seen by opthalmology who attributed his eye
symptoms to dry eyes. CT head w/ and w/o contrast was negative
for bleeds and metastatic disease.
.
# Shingles- Patient complained of continued post herpetic
neuralgia related to his shingles episode six months earlier.
His pain was managed with lidocaine patches and
oxycodone/oxycontin.
.
#. BPH: No active issues. Patient was continued on finasteride
and tamsulosin as his home BPH medications were not on
formulary.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 87754**],

You were admitted to the hospital with chest and abdominal pain.
You had a CT scan of your chest, lymph node and bone marrow
biopsies which showed that you have diffuse large B cell
lymphoma. You received two rounds of chemotherapy while you were
in the hospital. You were also diagnosed with a pneumonia for
which you were treated with antibiotics. You will need to have a
repeat CT of your chest in [**12-22**] weeks to assess the improvement
of this infection. Your body was retaining fluid so you were
started on a water pill to help remove some of this fluid.
Please continue to take this at home as directed until you
follow up on Friday. Please also weigh yourself daily and call
Dr.[**Name (NI) 14047**] office if your weight increases.

We have made the following changes to your medications:
- START taking filgrastim (injections) as directed for your
blood counts
- START taking fluconazole for prevention of infection
- START taking acyclovir for prevention of infection
- START taking ranitidine for your stomach
- START taking oxycontin for your pain; please take colace and
senna as needed while taking this medication to prevent
constipation; do not drive while taking oxycontin as it is
sedating
- START taking lasix for the fluid in your legs
- START taking potassium as directed while taking lasix
- you may use gelclair as needed for mucositis pain in your
mouth

You make continue taking your other medications as you were
previously.

It was a pleasure taking care of you. We wish you a speedy
recovery.

Followup Instructions:
Please come to the 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] Outpatient Clinic at 10:00AM on
Friday [**12-13**] for tests to check your blood counts and
your chemistries.
