History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 101562**] is a 64 year old woman with multiple medical problems
who was referred to our clinic for a pericardial window. She was
being evaluated by ENT (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] this spring for excision
of leukoplakia of the vocal cords when a moderate pericardial
effusion was discovered on pre-operative testing. Her
ENT procedure was postponed pending management of the effusion.
Of note, she is a poor historian and is unsure of her medical
issues or surgical plans. She had a pericardiocentesis performed
six months ago which drained 1L. She denies prior thoracic or
major abdominal surgery. She was recently placed on coumadin for
A-fib, she has held that for 2 days. Last INR available was 2.6
on [**2115-2-27**], then rechecked at 1.2 on [**2115-5-15**].

[**2115-5-21**] CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-20**], there is little
overall
change. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Atelectatic changes
are seen at the bases, especially on the left with small
bilateral pleural effusions.

preserved global biventricular systolic function. Moderate
mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No
significant pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 101562**] was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery service on the
day of her scheduled surgery, [**2115-5-15**]. INR was checked that day
(1.2). She underwent left video assisted thoracoscopic surgery
with pericardial window under Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The surgery was
uneventful and went as planned, but she remained intubated
overnight given her very high oxygen requirement. She was
transferred to the ICU intubated and an urgent pulmonology
consult was requested. Our pulmonology colleagues agreed with us
that she was retaining fluid leading to pulmonary edema so we
removed all IV fluid and began diuresis with furosemide IV. She
responded well and she was extubated in the afternoon of POD 1.
By POD 2, she had resumed most of her home medications and was
beginning a regular diet. Her Coumadin was resumed and
pericardial drain was removed (total output ) on POD 3. She
remained in the ICU until POD 4, the primary indication being
increased oxygen demand, requiring face tent most of the day.
Chest x-rays and daily weights indicated she was no longer fluid
overloaded, but her oxygenation continued to be poor. On the
floor, we were unable to keep her oxygen saturation above 90%
with less than 4L nasal canula. She reports this as her baseline
pulmonary status, though denies being on home oxygen. She was
seen and evaluated by physical therapy who initially recommended
rehab due to risk of fall. She also required 4L NC desaturating
to 84% on 2L NC. Over the next few days she improved.  Physical
therapy re-evaluated her and deemed her safe for home with PT.

While in house some mild confusion which improved over the
course of her hospital stay.  On discharge she was awake, alert,
oriented and walked independently.

Heme: Warfarin was restarted for atrial fibrillation and she
will follow-up with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 17143**] as an outpatient.

By the time of discharge on [**2115-5-23**], she was tolerating a
regular diet, voiding without difficulty, hemodynamically
stable, taking her home medications and ambulating independently
without oxygen, saturating 94% RA.   She was discharged to home
with [**Location (un) 86**] Care Group VNA and Physical therapy.  She will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
