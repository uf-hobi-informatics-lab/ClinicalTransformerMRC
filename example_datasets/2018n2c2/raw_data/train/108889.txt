Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2146-5-16**] where the patient underwent CABG x 3
as detailed in the operative report.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  Vancomycin was used for surgical
antibiotic prophylaxis, given the preoperative LOS of greater
than 24 hours.  POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and
oriented and breathing comfortably.  By POD 2 the patient was
hemodynamically stable, weaned from vasopressor/inotropic
support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without incident.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 85298**] was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
evaluation of her strength and mobility.  By the time of
discharge on POD five the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was cleared by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for discharge to home on
POD# five.  All follow up appointments were advised.
