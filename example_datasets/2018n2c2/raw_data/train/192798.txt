Service:  ACOVE
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, this is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
woman with a history of congestive heart failure,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, anemia, silent myocardial
infarction, AR/MR who presents on [**7-18**] with bilateral lower
extremity weakness and hip pain.  A hematocrit that was done
clots.  The patient was guaiac positive.  The [**Hospital 228**] home
health aides reported that the patient had melanotic stools
over the weekend.  The patient was transferred to the MICU
and was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells.
Hospital course was complicated by 2 to 1 atrial flutter with
heart rates in the 120s to 140s.  The patient had a troponin
peak of 6.4.  The patient was to be cardioverted, but self
q6h was started.  The patient was evaluated by
gastrointestinal who thought that the upper bleed was due to
NSAID use.  The patient was on Celebrex at home for arthritis
and degenerative joint disease and recently had increased a
dose from qd to [**Hospital1 **].  Gastroenterologists have decided not to
scope the patient given her age and comorbidities, unless she
becomes hemodynamically unstable in the future.  The patient
has been managed with q8h hematocrit checks and Protonix 40
mg.  MICU course was also complicated by decreased oxygen
saturations to the high 80s that was thought to be due to CSF
exacerbation.  The patient has been gently diuresed with
Lasix and is now saturating in the 90s on room air.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN - THE PATIENT GETS A RASH.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**Location (un) 5481**] [**Hospital3 **] Environment with 24 hour home health aide care.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 12.3, hematocrit
33.9; of note, hematocrit has remained stable during this
entire admission after transfusions, platelets 211.  PT 12.4,
PTT 24, INR 1.1.  Sodium 149, potassium 4.3, chloride 114,
bicarbonate 22, BUN 75, creatinine 1, platelets 146, calcium
9.9, phosphate 1.7, magnesium 2.7.  [**7-19**]:  Troponin 3.8

IMAGING:  Admission electrocardiogram revealed new ST segment
depressions in inferior and lateral leads, 2, F, V4, V5, V6
at 117 beats per minute, variable P-wave morphology, notched
P-waves.  Chest x-ray revealed bilateral effusions, linear
atelectasis at left mid lung zone.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate 100, respiratory rate 20, blood
pressure 132/64, oxygen saturation 99% on 40% face mask.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  No jugular venous
distention, no murmur.  Mucous membranes are moist.
Extraocular muscles intact.
LUNGS:  Positive crackles at bases bilaterally, right greater
than left.  Decreased breath sounds at bases bilaterally.
HEART:  Positive S1, positive S2, positive APCs, positive
holosystolic murmur heard best at apex.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, slightly decreased bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Trace edema bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, this is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman
with a history of congestive heart failure, dementia,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, degenerative joint disease
and arthritis who presents with upper gastrointestinal bleed
thought secondary to NSAID use who is now status post 4 units
of packed red blood cell transfusions.  MICU course is
complicated by atrial flutter and a troponin of 6.4.  The
patient's hematocrit was checked q8h and then [**Hospital1 **] during this
hospitalization.  Hematocrit has remained stable.  The
patient was followed by gastrointestinal who felt that the
patient did not need to be scoped at this time and should be
followed up as an outpatient if she has any other symptoms of
gastrointestinal bleeding.  During this hospitalization, the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by congestive heart
failure exacerbation due to the 4 units of packed red blood
cells.  The patient was diuresed with Lasix.  The patient is
currently on room air and will resume her outpatient Lasix
dose of 100 mg po q day.  The patient's troponin has
decreased while in house.  Most likely, the patient had a non
Q-wave myocardial infarction with atrial flutter.  The
patient is not a good candidate for aspirin because of her
upper gastrointestinal bleed.  Will continue Lopressor 12.5
mg [**Hospital1 **] and captopril 50 mg tid.  In terms of the patient's
anemia, the patient has normal renal function and will not be
discharged with Epogen injections.  The patient will get iron
and vitamin C as an outpatient.  The patient may need
occasional hematocrit checks in the future.
