Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
Severe nausea and vomiting.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Induction of Hemodialysis
Plasmapheresis
Kidney Transplant [**2155-4-17**]
[**2155-5-1**] small bowel obstruction, ex lap with LOA


History of Present Illness:
A 65 year-old woman with history of end-stage renal disease
scheduled for LRRT [**2155-4-8**] presenting with uremic symptoms. She
was admitted for induction of hemodialysis to prevent dialysis
disequilibrium after receiving her transplant.
.
In the ED, her vital signs were 98.3, 118/62, 90, 13, and 98%
RA.  She received zofran 4 mg IV x1 and was sent directly to
dialysis before arrival to the floor. At dialysis she had 0.5 kg
removed via a right tunnelled line that had been placed one week
ago for plasmapheresis (she underwent plasmaphereis to remove
antibodies against daughter's antigens-- daughter will provide
the donor kidney).

Upon arrival to the floor from HD, she feels much better. She
denies nausea or vomiting, and is looking forward to eating
dinner. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or
lightheadedness. ROS is positive for vertigo, worse with sitting
and standing, that she says has been ongoing for three months.
She says she was seen by ENT yesterday for evaluation of the
vertigo and was prescribed acyclovir for ?Zoster infection,
which she has not yet started. However, it appears the vertigo
developed several weeks before she started immunosuppressants
(which she started one week ago). She denies facial rash or
burning. ROS otherwise unremarkable.

Past Medical History:
- End-stage renal disease, likely due to lithium toxicity
- Questionable history of temporal arteritis versus polymyalgia
rheumatica on prednisone
- Severe bipolar disorder, controlled with Lamictal and Celexa
- Hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemia related to lithium
- Vertigo, on meclizine
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease
- Cholecystectomy in [**2144**]
- Right knee replacement in [**2144**]
- Left benign breast tumor resection 20 years ago
- Status post appendectomy
- History of difficult intubation
- [**2155-4-17**] living related renal transplant
-[**2155-5-1**] ex lap, LOA for SBO

Social History:
She used to work as secretary at the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] company, and
is retired since [**2146-4-9**]. She lives with her son and she has
four children. The patient denies any history of tobacco
smoking, alcohol abuse, or drug use.

Family History:
Her grandfather and one of her uncles suffered from Bright

Brief Hospital Course:
A 65 year-old woman with history of ESRD scheduled for LRRT
[**2155-4-8**] presenting with nausea and vomiting and emergent
induction of hemodialysis. She underwent HD without complication
and plasmapheresis to prevent transplant rejection. She received
Rituximab. Her transplant was postponed to 4/9/9 because it
seemed that she still had positive antibodies against her
daughters kidney, this however, turned out to be not
significant. She was continued on her immunosuppressant regimen
(cellcept/tacrolimus. She had an episode of fevers/chills and
was temporarily on vanc/zosyn, however, the sxs resumed and her
cultures remained negative.

On  [**2155-4-17**] she underwent living related renal transplant from
her daughter. It was noted that she had a very thin posterior
fascia and peritoneum. Therefore, the
kidney was ultimately intraperitoneal in the retroperitoneal
space. The iliac vessels were soft without significant plaque.
The donor kidney had a single renal artery with an early
bifurcation and a single renal vein and a single ureter. The
kidney pinked up and produced urine. Please refer to operative
note. Postop, she was sent to the SICU due to volume overload
and respiratory difficulty. Respiratory function improved. Urine
output was excellent.

She received plasmapheresis postop transplant for HLA
desensitization related to transplant for 3 more treatments
postop for a total of none treatments.  A total of 3 doses of
ATG were given postop op. Solumedrol was tapered. Prograf was
titrated to trough levels. Cellcept continued at 1 gram [**Hospital1 **].
Creatinine dropped to 0.6. Luminex was sent on [**4-22**]. Urine
output average 1.5 liters per day. BP was elevated to
180's/120s. Lopressor was uptitrated and Norvasc was started. BP
improved. Diet was advanced and tolerated. PT worked with her
and recommended a walker.

On postop day 4, she developed ecchymosis around incision with
extension to right hip and lower abdomen. She also started to
drain sero-sanguinous fluid from her incision.

On [**2155-4-21**], she fell in the bathroom after standing up from the
toilet striking her nose against the wall. She denied passing
out. She was alert and oriented. A stat head CT was done showing
no acute intracranial process. A sinus/[**Last Name (un) **]/max CT showed
questionable nondisplaced fracture of the nasal bone. She
developed bruising over her nose with mild-mod swelling. A
developed a frontal headache that was treated with tylenol and
iv pain medication.

She developed dizziness prompting a neurology consult on [**4-28**].
It was felt that this was not a vestibular process, but rather
findings were suggestive of cervical spondylosis with myelopathy
with dorsal column involvement, with impaired functional
position sensation given history of reduced range of motion of
the neck, upper motor neuron weakness at the deltoids, triceps,
and iliopsoas, reduced vibratory sensation, and brisk reflexes
throughout.  Recommendations were for the her to wear a soft
cervical collar at all times for two weeks (if tolerated), then
at least at nightwhile sleeping thereafter.

Around postop day 6, her abdomen appeared distended and she
complained of nausea. The incision started to oozed at the
inferior edge. This was opened at the inferior edge. She
continued to have diffuse bruising aroun the RLQ. She developed
nausea with vomiting that appeared bilious. LFTs increased (alt
144, ast 148, alk phos 296, t.bili 6.8). LFTs were monitored
daily with continued rise. Hepatitis screening was done. This
was negative for HAV, HBsAG, HCV. Hemolysis workup was negative.
Liver duplex was done twice noting a small amount of perihepatic
fluid, no intra or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation. GGT was
elevated suggestive of liver/biliary source of increased alk
phos that rose to 500 with t.bili of 4.9.

 A KUB was done showing distended loops of small bowel. An NG
tube was place. Abd CT ([**4-25**])revealed distended small bowel with
decompressed distal small bowel and relatively decompressed
colon consistent with small bowel obstruction. There was a
transition point in RLQ. There was no evidence of perforation.
Normal liver without biliary abnormalities. Small amount of
perihepatic ascites. She was kept NPO. LFTs fluctuated daily.
She received IV hydration. She started to have flatus and bowel
movements. Bowel movements increased in frequency.  On [**4-29**], the
NG tube was removed. KUB revealed persistenly dilated loops of
small bowel and air fluid levels. KUBs continued to show
distended loops with air fluid levels despite BMs.

Nausea/vomiting and diarrhea continued. The NG was replaced.
LFTs improved. On [**5-1**], she was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.
Postop diagnosis was small bowel obstruction. A wound vac was
applied to the lower portion of the incision that was opened.
Despite the vac, the wound continued to drain serous fluid. The
wound vac was discontinued and a gauze dressing was applied.
Drainage stopped and a topical dry gauze dressing was applied as
the wound healed.

She remained npo with an NG tube in place. Given prolonged npo
status, TPN was started. She developed watery diarrhea. Stool
cultures were negative. A CMV viral load was negative. Cellept
decreased to 500mg 3x/day.
Imodium was started. Diarrhea resolved. NG was removed and diet
slowly advanced and tolerated. TPN was discontinued. Ensure
supplements were tolerated tid. Imodium was discontinued.

On [**5-13**], hematocrit was 22.6. She was given 2 units of PRBC with
a hct increase to 28. She stabilized at 30.

PT recommended rehab was recommended. She was screened and
accepted at NE [**Hospital1 **]. Prograf was increased to 6mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-15**]
for a trough level of 6.4. Goal trough prograf level is 10. She
was left on prednisone 20mg qd due to high sensitivity to her
donor. She will require labs on [**5-16**] for chem 7 and a trough
prograf with results called to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**]. Labs should then be
done every Monday and Thursday.
