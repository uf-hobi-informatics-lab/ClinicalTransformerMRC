Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
R-sided weakness and R facial droop

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
66 year-old right-handed man with PMH
significant for HTN, a.fib (on Coumadin), s/p
defibrillator/pacemaker (he says for bradycardia) CAD s/p 2
stents, prior stroke(initially with left sided weakness but he
reports no residual weakness) presented to [**Hospital6 50929**] this morning with right sided weakness. He says he woke
up at 4AM to go to the bathroom, but upon awakening, noticed
that
his right hand and arm was weak. He tried getting out of bed,
but
fell to the ground because of right sided weakness. He says he
stayed on the ground for a few minutes, but was able to get
himself up. He noticed that the right side of his face was
drooping and that his speech was slurred. He was initially
brought to OSH, where a NCHCT showed a left basal ganglia
hemorrhage. He was given 10 mg of Vitamin K for an INR of 2.6
(no
FFP was given) and Labetalol 20 mg IV for a SBP in the 170s. He
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
  He says that he believes his right arm is most affected
(weakest, no sensory changes reported), followed by his face and
then his leg. He says there has not been any progression of his
symptoms since onset this morning upon awakening. No other
symptoms aside from right sided weakness and slurred speech,
inlcuding no sensory changes, visual changes, headache, vertigo,
nausea/vomiting. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he received Profilinine, was
ordered for 2 units FFP (did not receive while in ED, but was
due
to receive in ICU) and started on a Nicardipine gtt.


Neuro ROS: Positive for right sided weakness and dysarthria as
per HPI. He does note neck pain beginning yetserday evening, but
no headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia,
dysphagia,
lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. No
difficulties producing or comprehending speech. No focal
numbness, parasthesiae. He does report episode of urinary
incontinence with standing this morning, but no prior episode of
urinary incontinence.

General ROS: No fever or chills. No cough, shortness of breath,
chest pain or tightness, palpitations, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No dysuria. No rash.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2104-12-29**] 4:58 PM
Preliminary report
FINDINGS: A 17 x 14 mm intraparenchymal bleed in the left
lentiform nucleus is unchanged from the prior CT approximately
six hours prior. There is mild mass effect due to surrounding
edema with compression of the adjacent sulci, but no shift of
the normal midline structures or evidence of herniation. No new
foci of hemorrhage are present.
A hypodense region just anterior to the hemorrhage is likely an
old lacunar infarct. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size
and configuration. The basal cisterns are patent. The visualized
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities
are clear.

IMPRESSION: No change in the left lentiform nucleus
intraparenchymal hemorrhage. This is likely secondary to
hypertension. Further workup to exclude vascular or neoplastic
etiologies can be pursued based on clinical correlation.
.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2104-12-30**] 3:18 AM
FINDINGS: As seen on the previous CT, there is a 1.7 cm x 1.4 cm
x 2.4 cm
sized acute intracranial hematoma in the left basal ganglia with
surrounding
edema. There is no appreciable mass effect on the lateral
ventricle. There
is no midline shift. An old infarct is seen in the left anterior
basal
ganglia extending into the corona radiata with ex vacuo
dilatation of the left
lateral ventricle. Also seen are multiple chronic lacunar
infarcts in the
right caudate and lentiform nuclei. Visualized orbits, paranasal
sinuses, and
mastoid air cells are unremarkable. No fracture is seen.

CTA HEAD: Bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries,
vertebral
arteries, basilar artery and their major branches are patent
with no evidence
of stenosis, occlusion, or dissection. A small less than 2-mm
sized aneurysm
is seen arising from the left ICA bifurcation. The anterior
communicating
artery appears bulbous without any definite saccular aneurysm.

IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged left basal ganglia hemorrhage.

2. Chronic infarct in the left anterior basal ganglia with ex
vacuo
dilatation of the left lateral ventricle as described above.

3. Less than 2-mm sized outpouching from the left ICA
bifurcation may
represent a tiny aneurysm. The anterior communicating artery
appears bulbous without any definite saccular aneurysm.
.
Cardiology:
ECG Study Date of [**2104-12-29**]  2:45:18 PM


Sinus bradycardia. A-V conduction delay. Prolonged Q-T interval.
Marked
anterior and anterolateral T wave inversion consistent with
metabolic
abnormality or myocardial ischemia. No previous tracing
available for
comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 RHM with PMH significant for HTN, AF (on warfarin), s/p
defibrillator/pacemaker (for ? bradycardia) CAD s/p 2 stents,
prior stroke (initially with left sided weakness but no residual
deficit) presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] with right sided
weakness (arm>face>leg) and dysarthria. CT revealed a left basal
ganglia IPH and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2104-12-29**]. Given
the presence of the IPH, his warfarin was reversed and stopped.
Patient was initially admitted to the ICU given significant
hypertension requirinng an IV nicardipine infusion. He was
transferred to the floor on [**2104-12-30**]. CTA was stable and no
significant aneurysm was identified. Although the most likely
cause for his IPH is hypertension, it was not possible to do an
MRI to look for an underlying lesion given pacemaker. Aspirin
should be started in 1 week and he will not be continued on
warfarin. He was transferred to rehab on [**2104-12-31**] and has
neurology follow-up. He should have a repeat CT head with and
without contrast prior to his follow-up to assess for the
presence of an underlying mass lesion.
.
.
# Neuro: Patient had a previous stroke as above with no residual
deficits and presented with right face, arm and leg weakness in
the setting of some mild neck pain but no clear headache on
[**2104-12-29**]. At OSH he was found to have a left basal ganglia
hemorrhage. He was given 10 mg of Vitamin K for an INR of 2.6
(no FFP was given) and Labetalol 20 mg IV for a SBP in the 170s.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. At
[**Hospital1 18**] ED, he received Profilinine (activated factor IX) and
received 2 units FFP later for INR 2.3. Examination revealed
right hemiparesis and right facial droop with dysarthria but no
aphasia, neglect or visual field defect. He was started on a
Nicardipine infusion for SBP up to 200s and was admitted to the
neuro ICU.

His head CTs remained stable showing no extension of the bleed.
CTA showed an old infarct in the left anterior basal ganglia
extending into the corona radiata with ex vacuo dilatation of
the left lateral ventricle in addition to multiple chronic
lacunar infarcts in the right caudate and lentiform nuclei and
angiography demonstrated a less than 2-mm sized aneurysm arising
from the left ICA bifurcation.

Stroke risk factors were assessed with HbA1c 5.4% and FLP
revealed Cholesterol 240 TGCs 111 HDL 41 LDL 177. CEs were
negative. He was initially monitored with glucose fingersticks
and this was stopped after several normal readings. He was
therefore started on atorvastatin 40mg daily and his fasting
lipids should be repeated in 3 months.

He continued to receive daily vitamin K until [**2104-12-30**] and INR
on [**2104-12-31**] was 1.0. He passed bedside swallow evaluation and
was placed on a regular diet. He slowly improved and was
transferred to the neurology floor on [**2104-12-30**]. We held all
antiplatelets and aspirin 325mg should be started in 1 week. We
stopped warfarin due to his hemorrhage. We were unable to obtain
an MRI given the patient's pacemaker and he will therefore need
a repeat CT scan with contrast to evaluate any possible
malignancy underlying the hemorrhage before his neurology
appointment.

The most likely cause of his hemorrhage is a hypertensive bleed
although his hypertension was controlled previously. As above we
will evaluate with interval scan to look for an underlying
lesion which may have bled.

His weakness was slowly improving at the time of discharge. He
was stable and BP was controlled on his home medications. He was
assessed by PT and deemed to benefit from rehab. He was
therefore transferred to rehab on [**2104-12-31**].
.
# CVS: BP was initially uncontrolled and was markely
hypertensive requiring IV meds and ICU admission. This was
latterly controlled and BP on discharge was SBP 120s-130s. He
was briefly hypotensive in the setting IV nicardipine and home
anti-hypertensives and this resolved before transfer to the
flor. We continued patient's home lisinopril and carvedilol.  We
monitored his INR daily and was 1.0 on discharge. Warfarin was
stopped and he should be restarted on aspirin 325mg daily in 1
week. Patient was started on atorvastatin 40mg daily as above
and should have repeat FLP in 3 months.
.
# Renal: Patient was admitted with Cr 1.3. He was not known to
have CRF. His Cr rose to 1.6 post-CT contrast on [**2104-12-31**]. This
should be repeated in 2 days time and then at least weekly.
.
# Code: Full Code
.
.
TRANSITIONAL CARE  ISSUES:
Patient will need a repeat CT head scan with contrast as an
outpatient in [**4-24**] weeks from discharge. This has been requested.
Restart aspirin at 325mg daily in 1 week.
Please monitor Chem 7 as Cr rose from 1.3 to 1.6 following CT
contrast.
Repeat fasting lipids in 3 months.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at the
[**Known firstname 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. You presented with
right-sided weakness and facial droop. You had a CT scan and
were found to have a bleed in your brain in the area of the left
basal ganglia. As you were on warfarin (Coumadin) which is a
blood thinner and worsens bleeding, this was reversed with
medications and Coumadin was stopped. Your blood pressure was
initially high and you had to be treated with IV medications to
lower your blood pressure in the ICU. Your blood pressure
normalised and you were transferred to the neurology floor. You
did well and your strength on the right side was slowly
improving. Your warfarin was stopped and should not be continued
due to further risk of bleeding. You should stop aspirin
currently and restrat at 325mg daily in 1 week. We also started
atorvastatin for high cholesterol as your cholesterol was found
to be high. This should be repeated in 3 months time. Your
kidney function tests were also slightly abnormal following the
CT contrast and this will be followed at rehab. You were
continued on your other home medications. The most likely cause
of this brain hemorrhage was high blood pressure although given
your pacemaker we were unable to do an MRI. As a result you will
need to have a repeat CT scan in 6 weeks  as at this point the
blood should have reabsorbed and we will be able to look to see
if there is any lesion underlying your hemorrhage. You were
deemed appropriate for rehab and transferred to rehab on
[**2104-12-31**].
.
Medication changes:
We STOPPED aspirin and this should be restarted at 325mg daily
in 1 week
We STOPPED warfarin (Coumadin)
We STARTED atorvastatin 40mg daily for high cholesterol
Please continue your other medications as previously prescribed
