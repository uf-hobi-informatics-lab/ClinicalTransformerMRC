Lithium Toxicity

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
47 yo female w/ h/o bipolar d/o, schizophrenia and DM2, who
presents to the ED from [**Hospital1 1680**]-HRI with progressively worsening
mental status and tremulousness, found to have a lithium level
of 3.5. History was obtained by patient's nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1680**]-HRI.
At some point in [**Name (NI) 205**], pt's clozapine was discontinued due to
agranulocytosis. This resulted in an acute psychotic episode,
requiring hospitalization at [**Hospital1 1680**]-HRI on [**6-22**]. She has been
hospitalized at this facility for the past 5 weeks. Her nurse
notes that over the first 2-3 weeks of her hospitalization, she
steadily became more psychotic and paranoid, believing that she
was being poisoned. For the past 3 weeks, pt. has had very poor
PO intake. Per her nurse, she did not have any nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, abdominal pain, SOB, cough, chest pain, fevers, or
dysuria. Of note, a full set of basic labs were obtained on
[**7-18**]. These were all wnl, including a BUN/Cr of 24/0.8. She was
started on lithium 300mg TID on [**7-23**]. Over the past week, staff
have noted that she has been increasingly tremulous and unsteady
on her feet, requiring a walker to ambulate. Over the past two
days, pt. became increaisngly confused and incoherent. She was
refusing to get out of bed and being more agitated. A lithium
level was checked and was 3.5. This prompted transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED.

In the ED, initial VS were: 100.2 120 115/92 18 97%
Labs were notable for Lithium level of 3.0. Na 133 K 5.5 Cl 101

WBC 11.9 (74.2% PMN) HCT 43.8 Plt 288. PTT 30.5 INR 1.0

Pt. was noted to be very tremulous and agitated. A temporary HD
line was placed in the ED. For her agitation, she was given a
total of 4mg of Ativan, and was transfered to the MICU for HD
and further management.

      Reported to and read back by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **],9/05/12,12:05PM.

      GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.

EKG [**7-29**]: NSR, no abnormalities

CXR [**7-29**]: IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

TTE [**7-30**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No evidence of
vegetations. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

LUE US [**2138-8-2**]:
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] evaluation was
performed of the left upper extremity. Normal compressibility
and flow was seen in the left subclavian, internal jugular,
brachial, basilic and cephalic veins without evidence of left
upper extremity DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77651**] is a 47 y/o female with a h/o schizophrenia,
bipolar, DM, and hypothyroidism who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with
altered mental status and tremulous and was found to have
lithium toxicity, [**Last Name (un) **], and streptococcus viridans in bacteremia.

Acute Issues:
# Lithium Toxicity: The patient was found to ahve a Lithium
level of 3.0 on arrival. It is unlikely that this represents an
overdose as patient has been an inpatient at a psychiatric
hospital. She has only been on lithium for approximately 1 week.
It is likely that patient sustained an acute kidney injury over
the course of the past few weeks, causing decreased renal
lithium clearance, resulting in toxicicty. Toxicology and renal
were consulted. Temporary femoral HD line was placed, and she
was dialyzed x 1 session. Lithium level was checked 6 hours
after dialysis and was 1.0, re-check was 1.2, then came down to
0.9 as UOP picked up. Her lithium level decreased again to 0.7
and then to < 0.2.

# Acute Renal Failure: The patient was found to have a Cr of 3.3
on presentation (baseline was 0.8 on [**2138-7-18**]). This was likely
pre-renal [**12-26**] poor po intake over past few weeks. She received
2L boluses of NS and had maintenance fluids of NS at 200-250cc.
Her UOP increased significantly with aggressive hydration and
her creatinine returned to her baseline of 0.8.

# Streptococcus Viridans bacteremia: The patient was found to
have strep viridans present in [**11-25**] bottles. The patient was
initially started on Vancomycin and it was thought that the gram
positive cocci represented a contamination. Upon speciation of
strep viridans, Infectious Disease was consulted. They
considered this a low risk bacteremia and recommended 14 days of
ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily from negative cultures. Repeat cultures
on [**2138-7-30**] were with no growth. The temporary hemodialysis
catheter tip was sent for culture on [**7-31**] and was with no growth.
A midline was placed on [**2138-8-2**] for antibiotic administration and
antibiotics will be completed on [**2138-8-14**].

# AMS/Psychosis: Improved somewhat after dialysis and
normalization of lithium level. Agitation was generally well
controlled with PRN Ativan. Continued to be agitated and
responding to internal stimuli. Her antipsychotics were
initially held in setting of acute lithium toxicity due to
increased risk of NMS. Psych was consulted and followed patient.
They recommended re-starting her aripiprazole and it was slowly
titrated back to home dose of 30 mg daily. She was discharged to
inpatient psych bed on [**Hospital1 **] 4.

Chronic:
# Schizophrenia/Bioplar: Psych was consulted and followed
patient. Initially all psych meds were held in the setting of
acute lithium toxicity. Her aripriprazole was started back and
slowly titrated back to home dose. The remainder of psych meds
were held. She was discharged to inpatient psych bed on [**Hospital1 **] 4.

#DM2: The patient's home metformin was held during
hospitalization and she was maintained on insulin sliding scale.

#Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH was within normal limits. Her
home synthroid was continued during hospitalization and cytomel
will be restarted upon discharge.

Transitional Issues:
-Will need to complete 14 day course of ceftriaxone with 9/6
conuted as day 1 (to be completed on [**8-14**]).
-Psychiatry to continue titrating and adjust psychiatric
medicaitons.
-Patient will need to restart metformin when not refusing to
eat.
- patient will need Panorex and/or Dental eval for multiple
caries when acute psychosis improves as possible source for her
bacteremia

were also found to show that your kidneys were not functioning
well. You were treated with one session of hemodialysis and you
lithium level came down in to the normal range. We gave you IV
(through your vein) fluids and you kidney function returned to
[**Location 213**].

While you were here we also found that you had a bacteria in
your blood. To treat this we are giving you IV (through your
vein) antibiotics.

While you were here psychiatry followed you and adjusted your
