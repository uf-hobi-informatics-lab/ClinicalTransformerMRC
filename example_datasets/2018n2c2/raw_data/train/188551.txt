History of Present Illness:
The patient a 69 year old woman with a history of hypertension,
diabetes, and dementia now presenting on transfer from [**Hospital3 **]Hospital with a large left temporo-parietal bleed.  The
details of her history are sparse and are taken primarily from
her OSH chart.  She presented originally on [**7-22**] complaining of
worsened shortness of breath and generalized weakness.  A
tentative diagnosis of pulmonary embolus was made and she was
treated with lovenox.  She was also noted to be febrile and to
have slurred speech on admission.

Today, the medical staff noticed that the patient was not moving
her right side and was "relatively unresponsive."  A head CT was
then performed which showed a large bleed as described above.
Arrangements were made to transfer her to [**Hospital1 18**] for ICU level
care.

Head CT [**2173-7-26**]:
There is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left
frontoparietal region with extension into the ventricular
system. There is a moderate amount of edema surrounding this
hemorrhage and there is mass effect and approximately 1.4 cm of
midline shift to the right. There is subfalcine herniation.
Blood is seen in the left lateral ventricle as well as the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle. The sulci and
gyri of the entire left cerebral hemisphere are effaced. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation within the right hemisphere is
preserved. The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures
are unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses show
opacification of the right sphenoid sinus.

IMPRESSION: Large left frontoparietal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with extension into the ventricular system, mass
effect, midline shift, and uncal herniation. If prior
examinations exist, they would be helpful for comparison to
detail interval changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for management of her large
intraparenchymal bleed.  The etiology was thought to be most
likely from amyloid angiopathy.  The neurosurgery team consulted
and the patient and discussed options with the family and it was
decided that surgery (draining the lesion) would not likely
benefit the patient.  She was loaded with dilantin.  Her exam
remained stable.  The family made the patient DNR but not DNI.
A family meeting was held and the family decided in favor of
placing a tracheostomy tube and a PEG tube.  These procedures
were done without complication.  The patient was initially
placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis due to her ICH.  She
had no events and the dilantin was eventually d/c'd.  The
patient remained hemodynamically stable.  She has a goal SBP of
110-150.  The patient did appear to have a slight rash on her
truck upon d/c that was attributed to her dilantin that was
recently d/c'd.  On [**7-31**] she spiked a fever to 103 she remianed
febrile for ~ 5 days.  Eventually she had a sputum culture + for
staph aureus.  The patient was started on levofloxacin for a 10
day course.  At the time of d/c she was afebrile.  She was
accepted for placement at [**Hospital3 7**].
