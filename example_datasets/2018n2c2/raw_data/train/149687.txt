Admission Date:  [**2148-3-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2148-4-9**]

Service:  Transplant surgery.  #58

ADDENDUM:

The patient was anticipating discharge to the [**Hospital 17300**]
Rehabilitation Center on [**2148-4-4**].  However, the patient
was found to have rising liver function tests with a peak
total bilirubin level of 4.5 and, therefore, underwent an
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure on
this date.  This study demonstrated diffuse dilatation at the
proximal site of the biliary anastomosis, compatible with an
anastomotic stricture.  A 5 cm by #10 French plastic biliary
stent was, therefore, placed.

Following this procedure, the patient felt well clinically
without abdominal pain.  However, his amylase and lipase were
slightly elevated the day following the procedure and he was,
therefore, monitored for possible post endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis.  The patient was
maintained on his intravenous diuretics and his liver
function tests slowly returned to [**Location 1867**] following the
procedure.  However, on hospital day number 13, the patient
complained of left upper extremity swelling, which he states
had been there for some months prior to admission.  However,
given the presence of a left subclavian central venous line,
and this new finding on examination, a duplex ultrasound was
ordered for the left upper extremity which was consistent
with a deep venous thrombosis.  The patient was, therefore,
started on a heparin drip to be titrated to a goal PTT
between 40 to 60 seconds. He was also started on Coumadin 5
mg daily towards a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5.  At this time, the
patient was progressing well with physical therapy and was
discharged to the [**Hospital 17300**] Rehabilitation Center on hospital
day number 16, on a heparin drip, along with intravenous
Lasix and Coumadin.  His central venous line was removed
prior to discharge.  His heparin drip may be discontinued
once his INR reaches a level of 2.0.  He should be treated
for Coumadin for three months given his left upper extremity
deep vein thrombosis.  He will maintain his Lasix dose at 80
mg intravenous twice a day until his follow-up appointment on
[**2148-4-18**].  He is to have his laboratory studies drawn
twice weekly, on Monday and Thursday, and faxed to the
transplant center for adjustment of his Cyclosporin dosing.
This level is to be drawn two hours after his morning dose.
The patient was instructed to call the transplant center if
he had any other questions or concerns.
