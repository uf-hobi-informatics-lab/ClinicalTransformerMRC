HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 52 year old gentleman
with end-stage renal disease secondary to poly-cystic kidney
disease.  He has been on Hemodialysis for the past five years
via a left AV graft.  He presents now for a cadaveric renal
transplant.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Zestril 5 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Prilosec 20 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Celexa 20 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Rocaltrol one tablet p.o. q. day.
6.  Renagel 3200 mg p.o. three times a day.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Transplant Surgery Service on [**2130-2-20**], and underwent
an uncomplicated cadaveric renal transplant. The patient
tolerated the procedure well and had a postoperative course
that was significant for delayed graft function.  His
hospital course is summarized as follows by systems:
1.  Neurologic:  The patient had adequate pain control on a
morphine PCA postoperatively.  When the patient was
tolerating p.o. intake on postoperative day three, the
patient's PCA was discontinued and he was started on Percocet
for pain control with good effect.

2.  Respiratory:  The patient was requiring an oxygen
supplementation for the initial five days postoperatively
with oxygen saturations ranging from 93 to 95% on two liters.
Once the patient began ambulating and using his incentive
spirometer, he no longer needed supplemental oxygen,
saturating 95% on room air.

3.  Cardiovascular:  Immediately postoperatively, the
patient's Atenolol was held.  Back on postoperative day one,
the patient was noted to have a decrease in his systolic
blood pressure to around 90, coincident with a decrease in
his urine output.  The patient was given fluid boluses but
his pressure continued to decline, reaching a nadir of 74
systolic.  The decision was made to transfer the patient to
the SICU for closer monitoring of his volume status using his
CBP.  Once in the Unit, the patient's systolic pressure
increased to the low 100's.  He was started on a renal dose
Dopamine drip.  It was believed that his episode of
hypotension coincident with some shaking chills, was
secondary to a gamma globulin reaction.  His gamma globulin
was subsequently discontinued and he remained in the SICU
until postoperative day four.

At that time, the patient's systolic pressures were back up
into the 140s to 150s and he was making good urine.  He was
subsequently discharged to the Floor where his pressures
remained in the normal range throughout the remainder of his
hospital stay.  He had no complaints of chest pain or
shortness of breath throughout the hospital stay.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was tolerating a limited
p.o. intake by postoperative day two, but continued to
increase his p.o. intake to the point of tolerating a regular
renal diet by the day of discharge.  He was on a bowel
regimen of Colace and Dulcolax suppositories p.r.n.  He had a
bowel movement on postoperative day three.

5.  Genitourinary:  The patient's creatinine preoperatively
was 12.7, and in the PACU had dropped to 11.5 with a
potassium of 5.5.  However, coincident with his episode of
hypotension on the morning of postoperative day one, his
potassium had risen to 7.2 and his creatinine had jumped up
to 12.6.  Once in the SICU, the Renal Team decided to dialyze
the patient.  He underwent one treatment of hemodialysis.
His creatinine dropped to 8.7 with a potassium of 5.6.  Over
the next couple of days, his creatinine rose to level off at
a level of approximately 10.0.  There it remained for the
remainder of his hospital stay.  While he was in the
Intensive Care Unit he was receiving 80 mg of intravenous
Lasix twice daily to maintain his urine output.

After transferring to the Floor and maintaining an output of
approximately 250 cc an hour, his intravenous fluids were
discontinued on postoperative day five.  On postoperative day
six, his intravenous Lasix was discontinued and the patient
continued to have an adequate urine output.  At the time of
discharge, he still remained approximately 12 liters positive
from his preoperative dry weight.  It was noted that the
patient had some unilateral swelling of his right arm
concerning for a thrombosis secondary to the right IJ central
venous line.  On the [**2-24**], a right upper extremity
ultrasound was performed that demonstrated widely patent
venous outflow with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion.

It was felt that the unilateral swelling was secondary to the
patient's positive fluid status combined with poor venous
outflow secondary to his right AV fistula.

6.  Infectious Disease:  The patient had no infectious
complications throughout the course of his hospital stay.

7.  Immunosuppression:  The patient was initially started on
Thymoglobulin, CellCept, Solu-Medrol, postoperatively.  After
it was believed that the patient was having a reaction to
Thymoglobulin, he received a dose of 100 mg of Zenapax on
[**2-22**].  The Thymoglobulin was discontinued and he was
loaded on Rapamune.  The patient received a second dose of
Zenapax four days after the first dose.  Rapamune levels were
sent after the third dose and are pending at the time of this
dictation.  The patient's white count has levelled off at
around 5 to 6,000.

8.  Tubes, Lines and Drains:  The patient had a right
internal jugular line which was discontinued on postoperative
day five.  The patient's Foley catheter was removed on
postoperative day five and had absolutely no trouble voiding.
His [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain continued to put out greater than 30
cc over a 24 hour period, and therefore, the patient will be
discharged home with the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] in place.

DISPOSITION:   The patient is expected to be discharged on
[**2130-2-27**].

disease, status post cadaveric renal transplant.
