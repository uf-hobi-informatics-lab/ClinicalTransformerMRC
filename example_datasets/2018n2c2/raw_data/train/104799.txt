Prebypass
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is a PFO
with bidirectional flow.There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apex,
apical and midportions of the inferior, inferoseptal and septal
walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results on [**2153-2-13**] at 0945am

Patient became acutely ischemic when global LVEF was < 20% and
emergent cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.

Post bypass

Patient is in sinus rhythm. Patient is receiving infusions of
phenylephrine, epinephrine and milrinone. LVEF= 35%. Immediately
post bypass the mitral regurgitation was severe. A few minutes
later the mitral regurgitation was 2+. Aorta is intact post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital and underwent preoperative
work up.  On [**2153-2-13**] he was brought to the operating room and
underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  See operative
report for further details.  He received vancomycin for
perioperative antibiotics.  Post operatively he was transferred
to the intensive care unit for post operative management. He
awoke neurologically intact, was weaned form the ventilator and
extubated. He was started on betablockers, statin therapy and
diuresed toward his pre-operative weight with intermittant
boluses of IV lasix. His chest tubes and temporary pacing wires
were removed per protocol. The patient developed
thrombocytopenia with a platelet count down to 107,000, from
309,000.  HIT was sent and would return negative.  He did
develop acute renal failure with a creatinine rise to 2.7 (from
1.1) and oliguria.  Diuresis was held and creatinine would begin
to trend back down.  Oliguria resolved and the patient had
adequate urine output prior to discharge.  Cardiac rhythm became
atrial fibrillation and the patient was treated with amiodarone
and anti-coagulation was initiated with coumadin.  The patient
subsequently developed ventricular bigeminy and was returned to
the CVICU.  Lidocaine drip was started.  This would resolve and
the patient returned to the step-down unit.  He developed
erythema and tenderness around the left SVG harvest site and was
started on po keflex x7days. He was evaluated and treated by
physical therapy and cleared for discharge to home on POD#11 by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
