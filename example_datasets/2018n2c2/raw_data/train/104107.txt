aortic stenosis that has been followed and now reached a level
of 0.5 cm2 by echocardiography, who [**Known lastname 1834**] cardiac

is preserved.

Pertinent Results:
[**12-8**] Carotids
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid
arteries. Minimal plaque was identified.  On the right, peak
systolic velocities are 62, 66, 66 in the ICA, CCA, ECA
respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 0.9. This is consistent
with no stenosis.  On the left, peak systolic velocities are 59,
54, 73 in the ICA, CCA, ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio
is 1.1. This is consistent with no stenosis.  There is antegrade
flow in both vertebral arteries.

[**12-10**] abdominal u/s:
FINDINGS: The liver is normal in echotexture without focal
lesions. Gallbladder contains several layering stones without
signs of cholecystitis. Common bile duct is normal in diameter
measuring 0.4 cm. The pancreas is unremarkable. The aorta is
normal in diameter. The right kidney measures 10.1 cm in length.
There is a caliceal diverticulum in the upper pole containing
calcium with an additional 0.6 x 4.2 x 1.0 cm simple cyst. The
spleen is normal in size measuring 10.2 cm.

[**2194-12-12**] Liver needle biopsy:
   1) Mild portal chronic, predominantly mononuclear cell,
inflammation.
   2) Focal, mild steatosis.
   3) Trichrome stain:  Focal mild portal fibrosis.
   4) Iron stain:  No stainable iron.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 30842**] was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery service under the
care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Given his low platelet counts (74) at
[**Hospital1 **] and at [**Hospital1 18**], a hematology consult was obtained for
further evaluation.  His thrombocytopenia had been previously
documented and worked up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30843**].  An abdominal ultrasound
showed no signs of splenomegaly and his heparin-dependent
antibody assay was negative.  In addition, the Hepatology team
was asked to evaluate Mr. [**Known lastname 30842**] for his thrombocytopenia in the
presence of HCV.  On [**12-12**], Mr. [**Known lastname 30842**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an
ultrasound-guided liver biopsy.  The results were mild portal
chronic, predominantly mononuclear cell, inflammation; and
focal, mild steatosis.

Mr. [**Known lastname 30842**] was cleared for surgery by the Hematology and
Hepatology teams.  His chronic thrombocytopenia was attributed
to either ITP or HCV.  He received platelet transfusions
pre-operatively.  On [**12-18**], he [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] his CABG x1 and AVR
without complications.  Please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 5572**] Operative Note
for further detail.

Post-operatively, he did well.  He was extubated, his chest
tubes removed, and transferred to the floor by POD #2.  His
platelet and hematocrit levels were closely followed.  By the
time of discharge on POD #5, his epicardial wires were removed,
he was evaluated by physical therapy, had good pain control, and
was tolerating a regular diet, although complained of poor
appetite.  His Coumadin was restarted on [**12-20**] for his atrial
fibrillation.
