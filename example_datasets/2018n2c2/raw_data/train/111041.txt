Chief Complaint:
Asymptomatic

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2154-2-8**] Redo sternotomy, with Patch Repair of Pseudoaneurysm
under Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest


History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 year old male with known coronary disease, status
post coronary artery bypass grafting surgery in [**2137**]. He is an
active smoker and has severe COPD confirmed by PFT and recent CT
scan. On a CT scan in [**2151-8-14**], there was an incidental
finding of a focal aneurysmal outpouching of his ascending aorta
along with a left lingula mass. Further review by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
thought it looked like a penetrating atherosclerotic plaque that
had ulcerated and that it was only covered by a very thin aortic
wall and thus was at risk for rupture. He underwent a stent
graft repair of this in [**2151-11-14**]. Follow-up CT scan has
shown an endoleak with expanding pseudoaneurysm into his aortic
arch. Given his endoleak and expanding psuedoaneurysm, it has
been decided to return to the operating room for repair.

Pertinent Results:
[**2154-2-8**] Intraop TEE:
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is a stent in the ascending aorta beginning just outside
the valve. No residual aneurysm is seen. Image quality
limitation may be due to clot from the leak.

Post-CPB:
The patient is A-Paced, on no inotropes.
EF is slightly reduced to 45-50%.
RV systolic fxn remains mildly reduced.
MR remains 1+
Trace AI. Aorta intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent redo sternotomy repair of
pseudoaneurysm involving the distal ascending aorta with bovine
pericardial patch using deep
hypothermic circulatory arrest. For surgical details, please see
the operative note. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. He was transfused
with PRBC's to maintain a hematocrit near 30%. He remained in
the CVICU for aggressive bronchial hygiene and tenuous pulmonary
status with baseline COPD. He maintained stable hemodynamics and
was transferred to the step down unit on postoperative day two.
Physical therapy was consulted for evaluation of his strength
and mobility. He became acutely confused on POD#3. This
confusion was felt to be related to Ativan which was discontined
and within 24-48 hrs his confusion had resolved. Also on POD#3
serous sternal drainage was noted on his sternal wound without
any erythema or sternal click. He was placed on emperic
antibiotic coverage. He remained afebrile with stable white
blood counts and without any sign of infection. He remained in a
normal sinus rhythm.  He had an pleural air leak
postoperatively, however chest tubes and pacing wires were
removed without incident. He remained in the hospital for
extended period due to continued drainage and on post-operative
day eight this drainage had resolved and he was discharged with
ten days of Keflex to Newbridge on the [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation
Center.
