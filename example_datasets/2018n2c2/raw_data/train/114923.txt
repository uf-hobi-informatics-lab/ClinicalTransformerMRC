Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
GI Bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy
Right femoral line


History of Present Illness:
54 year old woman with past medical history significant for
diverticulosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, rhythm controlled
afib not on coumadin and chronic diastolic CHF who now presents
with
bright red blood per rectum for the past 12 hours.
.
Patient states her symptoms began last night about 8:15pm. She
had lower abd cramps and an episode of dark colored stool. She
had nausea with no emesis. Since then has had about 20 bloody
BMs, dark red in color, with some clots. She states she had
undercooked red meat and steamed vegatable for dinner last night
at Friend's home. Her friend had severe diarrhea overnight, but
no rectal bleeding. Pt denies fever/chill, NSAIDs use, but she
is on ASA 81mg daily. She complaints of dizziness last night.
Pt's abdominal pain is much improved now.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 96.4 P 97 BP 82/27 R 15 O2 sat
100% RA. Patient was given 1 liter NS and her BP improved. On
exam she had lower abdominal tenderness. She has dark red blood
on rectal exam but no more BMs in ER. GI and surgery were
called. NG lavage was negative for blood. Hct was 26 from
baseline of 43, so she was given 2 unit of blood (emergency
unit) and 6 units were cross matched. She was alert during these
encounter. Intravenous Protonix given and Cipro and flagyl were
also given. Access of PIV 18 gauge x 2 was established. At the
time of transfer to the ICU were 73 97/52 15 100%2L.
.
During her MICU course, GI and Surgery followed. She received
total of 6 U PRBC (last one at 8 AM today) 1 U FFP and her last
Bloody BM was 4:30 PM on [**1-30**]. Access was difficult, so despite
having 2 18G, a femoral line was placed and will be kept until
the morning. GI convinced her to have colonoscopy and so started
bowel prep tonight.
.

ECHO ([**2130-11-10**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-4-22**],
the patient is now in atrial fibrillation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension is identified. The other findings appear largely
similar. LV function is difficult to compare directly between
the studies given the current degree of tachycardia.
.
COLONOSCOPY:
Findings: ([**2131-1-12**])
Contents: Red blood was seen in the rectum and sigmoid colon.
Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen in the sigmoid
colon. Diverticulosis appeared to be severe, with no
identifiable single bleeding diverticulum.
Impression: Blood in the rectum and sigmoid colon Diverticulosis
of the sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to proximal
sigmoid colon
Recommendations: Unable to pass sigmoid due to spasm, dicomfort
and blood contents. No identifiable bleeding lesion in this
limited exam. If bleeding persists, please obtain bleeding scan,
contact IR. Consider surgical consult.
.
[**2132-2-1**]: Mutiple diverticuli throughout the colon. Able to get
to ileocecal valve this time with general sedation.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 year old woman with past medical history of diverticulosis
with past GI bleeds, atrial fibrillation (CHADS1, not on
coumadin) who presented with acute bright red blood per rectum,
hypotension and 20 point hematocrit drop. Patient was initially
in the MICU and then transferred to the floor where she
tolerated bowel preparation and underwent colonoscopy showing
diffuse diverticular disease but no more active bleeding.
.
# Bright red blood per rectum: Gastroenterology and General
Surgery followed the patient closely in-house. Hematocrit
stabilized after 6 units pRBC, 1 unit FFP. Etiology likely
diverticular bleed given her long-standing history of
constipation and history of significant diverticular bleeds.
Also on the differential but lower include ischemic colitis
given atrial fibrillation (without coumadin) and lactate 4.2
initially. Repeat colonoscopy revealed extensive diverticular
disease throughotu patient's colon. Her IV pantoprazole was
discontinued and patient started on clears diet which she
tolerated well; her diet was eventually advanced. Patient was
educated on dietary/bowel management for diverticuli and
discharged with close follow-up in GI and Gen [**Doctor First Name **] clinics.
Patient is to discuss surgical option, such as bowel resection,
given her significant history of dangerous diverticular bleeds
in the past (X3-4?)
.
# PRURITIC RASH: Slightly erythematous and excoriated. Responded
to Sarna lotion. Patient felt the IV pantoprazole caused her
rash.
.
# PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient remained in sinus
rhythm. Given her GI bleed, aspirin was held, to be restarted
upon discharge. She was continued on Propafenon short acting, to
resume her home long acting version upon discharge.
.
# CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Well compensated, although
likely tolerates rapid ventricular response very poorly. No
crackles and trace lower extremity edema on exam. After her
colonoscopy, patient's home Diltiazem dose was restarted in
short-acting form. Her enalapril was held to be restarted when
patient was discharged home.
.
# OSTEOARTHRITIS: Stable and pain well controlled with tylenol
and oxycodone PRN
.
# BLADDER TUMOR: No clinical evidence of recurrence and was
stable.
.
# Right Femoral line: Difficult access and initial IJ was
attempted unsuccessfully. Patient had two peripheral IVs as well
and after colonoscopy, had the right femoral line removed
without issues. Site remained clean, dry and intact until after
discharge.
.

Discharge Instructions:
-You were admitted with bright red blood in your bowel
movements. You were briefly in the ICU but stabilized well with
6 units of red blood cells. Colonoscopy showed you likely had a
bleed from the many diverticuli (outpouchings) you have in your
colon.

directed. We made the following changes to your medications
during this admission:
--> HOLD Furosemide 40mg daily until you discuss with your
primary care doctor

--> RESUME Rhythmol SR 225mg twice daily
--> RESUME Enalapril 20mg twice daily
.
-Contact your doctor or come to the Emergency Room should your
symptoms return. Also seek medical attention if you develop any
new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea,
vomiting or unusual stools.
