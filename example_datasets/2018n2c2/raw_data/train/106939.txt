Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bone Marrow Biopsy
Intra-abdominal and axillary Lymphnode Biopsies


History of Present Illness:
69 year old [**Location 12189**] only male with a history of TB
on INH, Rifampin, Pyrazinamide, AIDS CD4 156 who is followed by
the [**Hospital **] clinic and was recently evaluated on [**2170-10-4**] with
epigastric abdominal pain and found to have lymphoma on CT. The
abdominal pain is diffuse and achy. He states that he's had
abdominal pain x 1 month and recently returned from [**Country 3587**]
where he was evaluated and treated with a "medication" that
improved his symptoms there. However, he states that it has
worsened over the past few days which caused him to seek
attention in the [**Hospital **] clinic. He denies nausea, vomiting, or
diarrhea. He has mild constipation. As a result, a CT torso was
obtained on [**2170-10-5**] and the preliminary read showed multiple
masses suggestive of lymphoma. Per OMR records, the patient has
a long-standing history of abdominal pain since [**2164**] but imaging
was obtained only recently.

Based on the results of his CT scan, the patient was referred to
the ED for further evaluation. There, his LDH was 1095, uric
acid 22.6, AST 66, ALT 48, and sodium 129. He was subsequently
admitted to OB on TB precautions for further workup of his
grossly abnormal CT scan.

Past Medical History:
1. HIV: Diagnosed in [**2158**]. He did not disclose to his PCP at
[**Hospital1 18**], however, his HIV status until [**2165**] at which time he began
to see ID for treatment consideration. ARV-naive. No OIs
2. Pulmonary tuberculosis. Diagnosed in [**Country 3587**]. Started on
INH, Rifampin, Pyrazinamide and likely Streptomycin on [**7-22**],

[**2170**]. Streptomycin was stopped a few weeks later. [**9-20**] Rifampin

to Rifabutin in anticipation of starting antiretroviral therapy.

3. Transmetacarpal amputation ([**2137**] after a machine accident in

the war in [**Country 37027**])
4. Bilateral inguinal hernias
5. Herpes Zoster

Social History:
Has 17 children. He has a wife in [**Country 3587**]. He denies any
history of IV drug use. He was born in [**Country 37027**] and lived there
for 42 years, moved to [**Country 3587**], and has traveled back and
forth yearly to the US since [**2141**]. He denies current tobacco use
 although he has a 108-pack-year smoking history and the brother
whom he lives with smokes approximately four packs of cigarettes
a day. He stopped smoking in [**2135**] after a doctor advised him
against it. He also said he used to drink heavily although has
not used alcohol in years. He currently lives with his brother
[**Name (NI) 43334**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 43335**] who also only speaks [**Location 7972**].

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2170-10-9**] 2:21 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-8**], there has been
placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 3
cm above the carina. Left subclavian catheter extends to the
mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. Patchy areas of opacification
again seen, especially in the right upper zone.  Haziness of the
left and also probably right bases could reflect free pleural
fluid.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2170-10-10**] at 10:46:11 AM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
60-70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old [**Location 7972**] man with active
tuberculosis (on INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide), HIV (last CD4
count 156 on [**2170-9-20**]) who was recently evaluated for epigastric
abdominal pain and was found to have a CT demonstrating
mediastinal, mesenteric, and pelvic nodal masses compatible with
high-grade lymphoma.
.
# Abdominal Pain/Lymphadenopathy:  Pt presented with diffuse and
achy abdominal pain, which he had for the preceding month. He
went to the infectious disease clinic, where he had been
followed for his tuberculosis and HIV. A CT torso was performed
on [**2170-10-5**], with preliminary read showing multiple masses
suggestive of lymphoma. He was referred to the ED for
evaluation; his LDH was 1095 and uric acid 22.6. He was admitted
to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] hospitalists and rapidly transferred to the
BMT service for further management.  A bone marrow biopsy was
obtained surgery was emergently consulted for to obtain tissue.
The patiet underwent a mini ex-lap and axillary lymphnode
disection for biopsy.  Both bone marrow and abdominal lymphnode
biopsies demonstrated plasmablastic lymphoma.  The patient was
started on [**Hospital1 **] and tolerated the treatment well.  He was
discharged with instructions to follow-up with the hematology
clinic.
.
# Tumor lysis syndrome/methemoglobinemia: The patient was
admitted with concern- Check tumor lysis.  The renal team was
consulted on [**10-8**] for spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome, with
specific question of prophylactic hemodialysis, and recommended
rasburicase to decrease serum uric acid. Allopurinol was
continued.
On [**10-8**] in the evening, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7600**] for hypoxia with
desaturations to the 80's. He was given Lasix 20mg x 2 with
minimal improvement and was transferred to the ICU.  A
discrepancy was noted between his oxygen saturations and PaO2 on
ABG. Methemoglobin level was noted to be elevated at 10%.
Rasburicase was held given its known association with
methemoglobinemia.
.
# Tuberculosis/Eosinophilia/HIV: Infectious disease was
consulted for help with management of tuberculosis, HIV, and
possible parasitic infection given elevated eosinophilia; they
recommended continuing treatment for tuberculosis and treating
for possible parasitic infection with ivermectin x 2.
Charcot-[**Location (un) 5244**] crystals were seen in the stool, which was
thought to be secondary to successful treatment of intestinal
parasites.  The patient was continued on TB therapy with INH,
PZA, rifabutin.  Sputum from [**9-27**] had been positive for minimal
AFB, concerning for either profound immunosuppression,
noncompliance, and/or MDR TB.  MTD testing was negative for M.
Tuberculosis on [**10-3**].  The patient was continued on TB therapy.
Induced sputum samples from [**10-10**] and [**10-12**] were negative for AFB
on gram stain.  Repeat cultures were obtained on [**10-15**] and were
pending at the time of discharge.
Regarding the patient's HIV, the patient was ARV naive.  His
last CD 4 156 with VL 489,000.  Due to the need for
chemotherapy, it was felt that ARV therapy should be postponed.
Upon discharge, the patient was scheduled for follow-up with the
ID. clinic.
.
# Thrush: Several days following his inital chemotherapy
treatment, the patient was noted to have the [**Last Name (un) **] appearance of
oral thrush.   He was started on nystatin with instructions to
complete an outpatient treatment course.
.
# Inguinal Hernia:  Pt complained of intermittant abdominal pain
when standing or coughing.  On further exam, the patient was
note to have bilateral inguninal herias.  Surgery was consulted
for concer for infarction.  However, bith inguinal hernias were
reduced without difficulty.  No further interventions were
taken.
