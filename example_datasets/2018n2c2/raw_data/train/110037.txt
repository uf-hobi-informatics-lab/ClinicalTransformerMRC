Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p unwittnessed fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
78 year old woman who takes Plavix and Aspirin daily and fell
[**4-2**] at her daughter's home. The patient is intubated and non
communicative at the time of initial exam.  Her daughter and
health care proxy is able to relay the events from the time of
the patients fall at 430 pm [**4-2**]. Her daughter reports that she
was in another room when her mother fell.  The daughter heard
her mother fall and went immediately to her side. The patient
tripped on the last stair of her home. There was no observed
loss of consciousness and the patient stated at the time of the
fall that she lost her footing on the steps.  At baseline, the
patient has difficulty with her knees that caused her
unsteadiness.  The patient had a left eyebrow laceration from
the fall, but was completely neurologically intact per the
daughter. The daughter took the patient to [**Name (NI) 620**] [**Name (NI) **] . At 7pm
the pt became aphasic and lethargic and had a Head CT which
showed a large left intraparenchymal bleed.  The patient was
electively intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for definitive
care.

Imaging:
Head CT [**4-2**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Compared to two hours prior, there has
been slight
interval increase in the large left frontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, which now measures 7.5 x 3.8 cm in greatest
dimension, previously 6.7 x 3.8 cm. The hemorrhage has now
dissected into the left lateral ventricle with a small amount of
blood also layering within the right lateral ventricle. There is
mass effect on the ventricles, however no evidence of
hydrocephalus. 7 mm of rightward midline shift and subfalcine
herniation are unchanged. Moderately extensive right
parietotemporal subarachnoid hemorrhage is stable. The basal
cisterns are preserved with no evidence of uncal herniation. The
left lens is absent. There is no soft tissue hematoma or skull
fracture.
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight interval increase in extent of large left frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, now with extension into the left
lateral ventricle. No evidence of hydrocephalus.
2. Unchanged 7-mm of rightward midline shift.
3. Stable moderate right parietotemporal subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

Head CT [**4-3**]:
IMPRESSION: No significant change compared to eight hours prior
except for
slight redistribution of intraventricular blood products.
Unchanged large
left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and moderate right
subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

Head CT [**4-4**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been no significant interval
change in
multiple intracranial hemorrhages. The left frontal
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage measures 7.6 x 4.4 cm, grossly unchanged when
accounting for head position. The moderate right parietotemporal
subarachnoid hemorrhage is also unchanged. Small amount of blood
layering within the ventricles is unchanged. There is no new
hydrocephalus. Subfalcine herniation and 5 mm of rightward
midline shift are stable. Left lens is absent. The calvarium and
soft tissues are normal.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in large left frontal
IPH and
moderate right parietotemporal subarachnoid hemorrhage. No
change in mass
effect or intraventricular extension of blood. No hydrocephalus.


EKG [**4-3**]:
 Sinus rhythm with borderline resting sinus tachycardia. Left
ventricular
hypertrophy by voltage. Inferolateral ST-T wave changes with ST
segment
depressions may be due to ischemia, etc. Compared to the
previous tracing
of [**2169-4-2**] precordial voltage is more prominent. ST-T wave
changes are
more apparent. Clinical correlation is suggested.

EKG [**4-5**]:
There is arm lead reversal. Sinus rhythm. Left atrial
abnormality. Probable left ventricular hypertrophy with
secondary repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2169-4-3**] no diagnostic change.

CXR [**4-5**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the
pre-existing left
lower lung opacity has slightly increased in density and evolves
towards a
retrocardiac consolidation. The pre-existing left lower lobe
opacity is of
similar density but slightly more extensive, the changes could
be consistent with bilateral evolving aspiration pneumonia.  The
size of the cardiac silhouette is slightly increased. There is
no evidence of fluid overload. The monitoring and support
devices are unchanged. No evidence of larger pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after transfer from OSH with
significantly sized intracranial hemorrhage while on
anticoagulation therapy from previous cardiac surgery. Upon
admission; she was administered platelets and admitted to the
intensive care unit for continuous monitoring. On [**4-3**], repeat
head CT was performed and determined to be stable, and not
indicitative of ongoing hemorrhage. She was subsequently
extubated. On [**4-4**], she was observed to have difficulty managing
her secretions, and an arterial blood gas was performed and
revealed a PaO2 in the 50s, and was reintubated. Head CT was
again performed to evaluate whether the ICH had evolved to
attribute to the poor respiratory effort, but was stable. On
[**4-5**], a bedside mini bronchoscopy was done to evaluate if she
had aspirated any secretions during her period of poor
respiratory effort. A lung consolidation was identified, and
antibiotics were started. On [**4-5**] her exam was stable and social
work was consulted for family regarding the possibility for
trach/peg & DNR/I status.  On [**4-6**] her sodium was 153, mannitol
was stopped, free H2O was increased to 150cc QID, and her exam
was stable.  On [**4-7**] she had a troponin leak 1.19 and a family
meeting w/ palliative care where the conclusion was to make her
CMO and she was eventually extubated and started on morphine for
comfort.  On [**4-8**] she passed away.
