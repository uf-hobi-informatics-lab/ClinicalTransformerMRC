Chief Complaint:
"Weakness all over my body"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**10/2162**]: Vtach/vfib arrest s/p cardioversion now on chronic
amiodarone therapy
[**2162-10-25**]: Percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement.

History of Present Illness:
84 yo male with multiple medical problems, including
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, CAD, and history of CVA's
who presented to the ED with a 24 history of weakness, cough,
SOB and nausea. He denied fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal
pain. Emesis x 1 that AM. In ED he was found to be hypoxemic w/
sats 85% on RA, pulmonary edema on CXR and SBP in the 80's. On
presentation, however, the patient was alert and oriented,
appropriate and mentating well. He initially received 2L NS for
IVF hydration, as well as antibiotics including ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, vancomycin for suspected community acquired
pneumonia. The patient then went into rapid afib with HR in the
140's. He was given 5 mg Lopressor IV and his HR decreased to
100. However, the patient's respiratory status declined
precipitously and his sats dipped to 86% on a 100% face mask. He
was placed on a nonrebreather and subsequently intubated in the
setting of impending respiratory failure. Peri-intubation the
patient again became hypotensive with SBP in the 80-60's and was
started on dopamine and dilt for rate control. After intubation
and central line placement, the patient was transferred to the
MICU and admitted with a running diagnosis of sepsis caused by
an underlying community acquired pneumonia.

Although the patient had a extensive medical history and problem
list, prior to presentation and subsequent admission to the
hospital he was fairly independent and ambulatory, living at
home with his wife.

IMPRESSION:
1. No CT evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. Bilateral large pleural effusions with bibasilar
collapse/consolidation.
3. Multiple hepatic cysts.

TTE ECHO Study Date of [**2162-10-4**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened with the
posterior
leaflet be calcified and prolapsing. Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape
unavailable for
review) of [**2158-5-2**], left ventricular systolic function may have
decreased.

TEE ECHO Study Date of [**2162-10-6**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%)
(intinsic LV systolic function may be depressed given the
severity of mitral regurgitation). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse. There is partial
posterior mitral leaflet flail. There is a echodense mass on the
posterior leaflet consistent with probable old vegetation on the
mitral valve; small mobile echodense mass is associated that may
represent a possible new vegetation. Eccentric, anteriorly
directed, moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the tricuspid or pulmonic valves.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Probable old (healed) mitral valve vegetation;
cannot exclude
small superimposed new vegetation. Mitral valve prolapse with
partial flail of the posterior leaflet and moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation. Mild to moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation. Mild to moderate (2+) tricuspid regurgitation.
Normal biventricular systolic function (LVEF 60-70%)(intrinisic
LV systolic function may be depressed given the severity of
mitral regurgitation).

ECHO Study Date of [**2162-10-10**]
Conclusions:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is
partial mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but
cannot be quantified. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review)of [**2162-10-6**], there is no significant change

ECHO Study Date of [**2162-11-1**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal(LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
partial mitral leaflet flail. Mitral regurgitation is present
but cannot be quantified.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2162-10-10**], the mass on the posterior mitral valve leaflet is more
prominent. This may
represent a flailed mitral valve leaflet with chordae or it may
represent a vegetation. If the mass is a vegetation, and because
this mass appears
calcified, this mass might be a healed vegetation. The mitral
regurgitation is hard to quantify in this present study.

TEE ECHO Study Date of [**2162-11-3**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be
more depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are complex (>4mm, non-mobile) atheroma in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened, but no
aortic stenosis is present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is partial
flail of the posterior leaflet with leaflet tethering and a very
small (~2mm) mobile echodensity at the leaflet tip that likely
represents a ruptured chordae (cannot exclude a vegetation if
clinically suggested).. An eccentric jet of severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. An echodense "mass" is seen in close
proximity to the mitral annulus. This may represent a healed
abscess or
atypical mitral annular calcification. A mobile mass is seen
attached to the posterior leaflet. This may represent a torn
chordae or a healed vegetation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic
valve or tricuspid valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-11-5**] 11:09 AM
IMPRESSION:
1) Worsening pulmonary edema.
2) Moderate bilateral pleural effusions,which have increased
compared to [**2162-10-4**]. There is bibasilar atelectasis as
well. A pneumonia in these consolidative areas cannot be fully
excluded.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-11-15**] 2:48 PM
CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: As on the prior study, there are
large bilateral effusions, stable since the prior study. The
previously noted bilateral upper lobe air space disease has
progressed and appears more densely consolidated, particularly
within the right upper lobe, and to a lesser extent the left
upper lobe. Additionally, Hounsfield units within the areas of
dense consolidation measure up to approximately 67 Hounsfield
units, which is denser than simple fluid, indicating complex
fluid, possibly hemorrhage.
A tracheostomy tube is noted. No mediastinal adenopathy.
Bibasilar collapse is once again identified, unchanged. Mitral
valve calcifications as well as coronary calcifications are
seen. A right subclavian line is noted, with its tip in the
superior vena cava.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Multiple low-attenuation lesions
are seen within the liver, measuring up to approximately 6 cm,
probably representing cysts. A gastrostomy tube is noted.
Unenhanced gallbladder, adrenals, kidneys, and spleen appear
normal. The pancreas contains a few punctate calcifications,
with extensive calcifications noted within the splenic artery.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The unenhanced colon, urinary
bladder and seminal vesicles are grossly normal. An open left
inguinal ring containing fat is identified.
BONE WINDOWS: There is severe demineralization within the sacrum
and left iliac bone, with degenerative changes noted within the
remainder of the spine.
IMPRESSION: Dense consolidation within the upper lobes, which is
increased since the prior study dated [**2162-11-5**]. The
density of the consolidation suggests complex fluid and is
compatible with hemorrhage, particularly given the clinical
history.

ECHO Study Date of [**2162-11-17**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is partial mitral leaflet flail.
There is moderate thickening/calcification of the mitral valve
chordae (no definite vegetation seen; cannot exclude
vegetation/healed vegetation). Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2162-11-1**],
there is no
significant change.

[**2162-12-1**]: Cardiac catheterization: Report pending at the time of
transfer.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the MICU with a diagnosis of sepsis
and community acquired pneumonia. He had a long and complicated
hospital course that will be described by system.

1. Respiratory: The patient was intubated on the day of
admission for hypoxic respiratory failure presumably related to
sepsis and CAP in the setting of baseline CHF. In the ED, the
patient received a dose of ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and
vancomycin. He was initially continued on Vancomycin and also
started on Levaquin for ABx coverage for presumed community
acquired pneumonia. Blood cultures drawn on the date of
admission [**10-4**] showed 1/2 bottles positive for Staph Coag Neg.
Further blood cultures were negative. He then developed
ventilator associated pneumonia with MRSA. He was given
Linezolid for coverage of MRSA and completed a 2-week course on
[**2162-10-25**].  He required trach placement on [**2162-10-25**] for failure
to wean. His sputum cultures were repeatedly positive for MRSA
and pseudomonas and enterobacter cloacea througout his
hospitalization. He was treated with vancomycin and meropenem
from [**2162-10-31**] through [**2162-11-13**]. The vancomycin was restarted on
[**2162-11-15**] after he spiked a fever and had MRSA in sputum again and
this was continued until his discharge. He was started on
ceftazidime on [**2162-11-23**] and that was also continued until his
discharge.  He was also treated with Flagyl early in the
hospitalization for presumed aspiration pneumonia. Most recent
sputum cultures from [**2162-11-29**] were positive for MRSA and
pseudomonas sensitive to ceftazidime. His latest ventilator
settings were AC/0.4/TV=600/RR=10/PEEP=5. He had repeated trials
with a Passy-Miur valve that were unsuccessful leading to
coughing fits.

2. CV: The patient was initially hypotensive at the time of
admission, likely related to sepsis +/- possible adrenal
insufficiency. On admission, he was started on stress dose
steroids and overnight remained on dopamine. The patient was
able to be weaned off pressors after the first night, but
subsquently required intermitent use of pressors to maintain his
SBP.

2.1. Rhythm: He was in afib with a rapid ventricular response on
admisison that was treated with a diltiazem drip, lopressor and
digoxin. He developed polymorphic VT with a transition to Vfib
on [**2162-10-23**] that responded to defibrillation. He was started on
a lidocaine drip and then switched to amiodarone. The amiodarone
dose was decreased on [**2162-11-28**] in attempt to decrease the beta
blocker effect in the face of CHF. He is to remain on Amiodarone
200 mg PO daily. He also went into atrial fibrillation early in
the hospital course that resolved with discontinuation of
dobutamine. He was in normal sinus rhythm at the time of
discharge.

3. Mitral Regurgitation: Per echo he has 4+ MR, which has been
refractory to medical therapy. Fluid overload was a major issue.
He underwent ultrafiltation in the CCU for several days with
removal of 18L of fluid. Upon completion of ultrafiltration he
was diuresed unsuccessfully with lasix boluses. He was started
on a lasix drip with a goal of even to negative fluid balance.
However, we were limited given his hypotension and had to be
held frequently. His blood pressure also did not tolerate
nesiritide. Captopril was added at a dose of 12.5 mg TID for
afterload reduction, along with Lasix drip as tolerated by BP.
Digoxin was also added for inotropic effect. Close to discharge,
the patient was tolerating captopril plus intermittent lasix
drip of 2mg/hr titrated to blood pressure. The lasix drip was
converted to a standing dose of 40mg IV BID. Metolazone 5mg po
BID was also added for synergy.  Pt did well on this regimen x
48hrs prior to the time of discharge. Pt was initially informed
that he may be candidate for MV replacement surgery, but was
subsequently refused this surgery by the CT [**Doctor First Name **] service who
felt that his operative risk was too high given his significant
comorbities.

4 History of endocarditis ([**2127**]'s): TEE showed a question of a
vegetation on MV. Subsequently, low suspicion.

5. Agitation: Pt was kept on a standing dose of haldol 2.5 mg
TID which was effective.

7. Nutrition: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a PEG tube and was tolerating tube
feeds using Respalor Full strength at 50cc/hr.  Vit C and Zinc
were added per nutrition recommendations.

8. Endocrine: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has known panhypopituitarism. He was
admitted on prednisone 5 mg daily (home dose). He required
stress dose steroids for his adrenal, subsequently tapered to 20
mg PO daily, on which he remains at the time of discharge.

Regarding his diabetes, serum glucose was well controlled on an
insulin sliding scale starting with 5 units for FSG > 150 and
incrementing by 2 units.

9. Hematology: He had thrombocytopenia initially on admission.
HIT antibody was negative. His thrombocytopenia was subsequently
attributed to Linezolid, and resolved several days after
linezolid was discontinued. Platelet count 170s on day of
discharge.

10. Prophylaxis: Pt was treated with Carafate for GI prophylaxis
(given thrombocytopenia) and Heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis.

11. Physical Therapy: Pt was felt to be progressing well from a
PT standpoint. He will need continued aggressive PT follow-up.

12. Access: A right subclavian was placed on [**2162-11-14**] and a PICC
line was placed on [**2162-11-30**].
