Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory disress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo lady with a history of COPD, CHF,
alzheimer's and expressive aphasia, who presented from her
nursing home to the ED in respiratory distress on [**2152-7-26**] about
1.5 hours after eating her lunch. She has had an episode of
aspiration about one year ago as well as urosepsis a few months
ago. In the ED, her vitals were T 98.9F, HR 130, BP 158/66, RR
40 and O2 sat of 91% on RL. A chest xray taken showed widespread
coarse reticular opacities but no signs of consolidation. She
was given solumedrol given her history of COPD. She was also
started on IV Vancomycine and Aztreonam (due to a PCN allergy)
as well as metronidazole. She was also given 1L Normal Saline
for alactate of 4.7.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia. She was then
admitted to the MICU for further care.

In the MICU, her Aztreonam was dc'ed, and she was started on
cefepime instead. She was also started on an insulin sliding
scale. Her lactate returned to 1.3, and her cre and WBC trended
down as well (WBC 26). Her IV fluids were tricky since any flow
>75cc/hr led to hypertension with sbp int he 170's. However, she
was able to tolerate small boluses of fluids. A straight cath
performed also showed purulent liquid, though her urine cultures
from [**2152-7-25**] were negative. After a few hours in the MICU, she
was transferred to the floor.

CXR ([**7-28**]):

FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**7-25**], the diffuse
bilateral pulmonary opacifications are less prominent.  Some of
this may reflect the PA rather than AP frontal view.  Blunting
of the costophrenic angles is consistent with bilateral pleural
effusions with some compressive atelectasis at the bases.

CXR ([**7-25**]):
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
mild increase in the diameter of the pulmonary vessels,
potentially indicative of mild fluid overload.  In addition, the
atelectasis at the left lung base has increased in extent and
there is blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially
caused by a small left pleural effusion.  No cardiomegaly.
Unchanged tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No pneumothorax.

EKG: [**2152-6-30**]:
Sinus rhythm and occasional atrial ectopy. Low limb lead
voltage. Prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2152-7-26**] the axis is more rightward, atrial ectopy has
appeared. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]F with a history of COPD, alzheimer's dementia,
and aspiration who presented from her nursing home in acute
respiratory distress after eating lunch.

SIRS 4 PROGRESS NOTE [**2152-7-29**]
Assessment and Plan:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]F with a history of COPD, alzheimer's dementia,
and aspiration who presented from her nursing home in acute
respiratory distress after eating lunch.

# Respiratory Distress: Possibly secondary to aspiration, which
is consistent with the presentation 1.5 hours after lunch.
Initial CXR showed multiple reticular opacities but no
consolidations. Repeat CXR showed less prominant bilateral
opacifications, though there is possible bilateral pleural
effusions with some compressed atelectasis at the bases.
Initially on Vancomycin and Cefepime, switched to IV Ceftriaxone
to treat UTI since pna was unlikely. IVF was at 40cc/ml for the
last 3 days of her hospitalization. PO trial of thick liquids
started on [**2152-7-29**], which pt tolerated well. Lungs sounded a lot
clearer with residual right base crackles. Pt breathing
comfortably at 94% O2 sat on room air.

# Abnormal EKG - Admission EKG read yesterday by Cardiology, who
was concerned about possible acute event. However, EKG compared
with one in [**2142**], which also showed similar changes. Troponins
elevated at 0.06 x 2 but did not trend up, likely from transient
ischemia due to increased cardiac demand [**12-30**] infection. No signs
of acute cardiac event. Medical management with beta blocker,
asa discussed with family, who declined due to allergy to asa
and desire for minimal medication.  Patient did tolerate
beta-blocker (metoprolol 6.25mg) for one dose and seemed to perk
up afterwards, but given difficulty in administration here in
the hospital (took patient an hour to swallow pill) did not
continue.  Can be considered as outpatient.

# Sepsis: Resolved. Likely secondary to a UTI. Grossly positive
UA though urine culture was negative, PMH of recurrent UTIs,
recent admission to [**Hospital3 **] with urosepsis from
multi-drug resistant E.coli, necessitating treatment with
primaxin. Straight cath in MICU drained purulent material. Urine
culture showed no growth, but per pt's son, pt had already
received IV abx at that time. Plan to complete 7 day course of
ceftriaxone on [**2152-8-3**].

# Volume status: Tenuous. Per MICU and patient's son, patient
become hypotensive with no fluids but rapidly becomes
hypertensive (up to sbp of 170's)if fluids given too fast. At
present appears to respond well to slow small fluid boluses, at
a rate of 75-100cc/hr. Was continued on IVF at 40cc/hr per pts
son as an amount that she has tolerated well in the past.

# Diabetes Mellitus Type II: Started on ISS on [**2152-7-26**], but NPO,
became hypoglycemic and ISS was downtitrated in the MICU.
Changed to regular insulin sliding. Glucose stable. Januvia held
while inpatient and continued to use reduced dose insulin
slididng scale.  Can restart Januvia on d/c.

# Sacral pressure ulcer: Wound care recs - Plan:  Pressure
redistribution measures, turn and reposition every 1-2 hrs off
back. Limit sit time to 1 hr at time and sit on a pressure
redist cushion.
Protect intact skin midback and coccyx area with Critic aid
Clear
daily and prn or every 3rd cleansing.

# Pruritus: pt developed agitated pruritus starting about 15
minutes after her cefepime infusion two days ago. Resolved on
switch to ceftriaxone.

# Hypokalemia: Resolved after repletion.

#General - PT discontinued because it was too rigorous. Followed
their initial recs of OOBx3 per day.
.
Transitional Issues
- Encourage PO intake
- Completion of ceftriaxone 1gm q24 hrs - last dose on [**2152-8-3**]
- Consideration of maintenance fluids
- Consider beta blocker (per pt's family, pt seemed to perk up
after single dose of metoprolol 6.25mg PO. Systolic BP decreased
to 120's, HR in 70's, Respiration rate to 16-20).

Discharge Instructions:
Mrs [**Known lastname **], you were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] due to concern for a
respiratory infection. You were found to have a urine infection.
 A chest xray showed no evidence of a pneumonia, so we think its
more likely that a urinary infection was causing your worsening
status. You were given antibiotics and for a few days we didn't
give you any food by mouth and gave it instead through your IV.
When you had improved and were eating small amounts of food
again, you were discharged back to [**Hospital3 **].

You will need 2 more days of ceftriaxone for your urinary
infection

Followup Instructions:
You will be discharged back to [**Hospital3 **] and should continue
care under your prior outpatient doctors.
