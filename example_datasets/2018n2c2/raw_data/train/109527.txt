Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2042**]
Chief Complaint:
Pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
62 yo female with history of hypothyroidism and chronic back
pain s/p multiple back surgeries wuth epidural steroid injection
2 months prior to admission who presented to OSH with fever for
5 days, found to have pancreatitis and multifocal pneumonia,
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.
On admission at OSH [**8-28**], she was found to have elevated lipase
(peak 1690, down to 613 on transfer), elevated LFTs (admission
AST 130/ALT 143/Alk phos 179, transfer AST 43/ALT 67/Alk phos
113/T bili 0.5), and MRI findings consistent with acute
pancreatitis. MRCP showed no fluid collection, pseudocyst,
abscess, biliary duct dilation, nor pancreatic duct dilation.
Patient was initially managed with IVF. She became increasingly
short of breath on [**8-29**] however, saturating 90% on 4L O2, and
was transferred to the OSH ICU. CXR showed bilateral patchy
infiltates concerning for biliary sepsis. CT Chest showed
extensive consolidation with air bronchograms in RUL and ground
glass opacities in LUL as well as small bilateral pleural
effusions. CT pelvis negative for abscess. She was started on
antibiotics (vanc, zosyn, moxifloxacin) and cultures were sent
(pending). She is being transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for ERCP on Tuesday.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she is afebrile and pain-free.

[**2183-9-4**] Chest CT:CT CHEST
REASON FOR EXAM: Characterize diffuse opacities described in
prior chest
x-ray from [**8-31**] and [**9-1**].

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT through the chest was acquired
without IV
contrast. 5-, 1.25-mm collimation images, sagittal and coronal
reformations were provided and reviewed.

FINDINGS: The airways are patent to the segmental level. There
is increase in number and size of mediastinal lymph nodes
located in all stations. They measure up to 8 mm in the
prevascular station, 10 mm in the upper pretracheal station, in
the left lower paratracheal station measuring 10 mm, precarinal
station up to 12 mm. Evaluation of hilar lymph nodes is limited
due to the lack of IV contrast. Some of the lymph nodes are
calcified in the left hilum and the left paraesophageal station.
There is mild cardiomegaly. There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild-to-moderate calcifications are in the LAD and circumflex
coronary arteries. Cardiac size is normal.

Large right and moderate left pleural effusions are layering and

nonhemorrhagic, associated with adjacent areas of atelectasis. A
noncalcified lung nodule in the right lower lobe measures 5 mm
(4, 105). Large multiple areas of ground glass opacity
associated with smooth interlobular septal thickening are
present in the upper lobes bilaterally, right greater than left.
The upper abdomen is unremarkable. There are no bone findings of
malignancy

IMPRESSION: Improved pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural
effusions.
5-mm right lower lobe lung nodule. Followup in one year is
recommended.
Cardiomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Acute renal failure: Developed after transfer from OSH,
likely ATN secondary to contrast load on [**2183-8-30**] + SIRS +
hypotension in the ICU overnight the evening of [**2183-8-31**]. FENa
5%, lytes remained stable. Patient was given continuous IV
fluids and developed post-ATN diuresis complicated by one
episode of hypernatremia. Her creatinine slowly improved and was
1.5 at the time of discharge.
.
2) ?Multifocal pneumonia: Could very well have represented ARDS,
but given fevers, persistent oxygen requirement and concerning
CT at OSH patient was treated with Vanc/Zosyn. Blood cultures
were sent at the OSH and remained negative. Patient was weaned
off of oxygen and remained stable on room air.
.
3) Pancreatitis: Lipase significantly decreased by the time of
transfer; patient was never nauseous or with abdominal pain.
ERCP was not felt to be indicated and she was followed
clinically as her diet was advanced. A repeat MRCP performed on
[**2183-9-11**] was normal.
.
4) Intermittent fevers: Patient had continued low-grade fevers
throughout her hospital stay. CXR, UA, blood cultures, and MRCP
were unrevealing. Infectious disease was consulted and
suggested that a drug reaction to penicillin be considered as
part of the differential diagnosis, but also recommended Hep C,
Hep B, RPR, and HIV as initial work up. These were obtained and
returned negative prior to the patient's discharge except for
the Hepatitis C serologies which are still pending. As the
workup was in progress, the patient's fever curve decreased and
she subsequently became afebrile 3 days prior to her discharge.
Because the patient deffervesced, the infectious disease service
did not feel that an echocardiogram, blood smears for parasites,
or other serologies needed to be pursued as an inpatient. The
service made two other recommendations:
A) a shorter follow up interval for her small lung nodule than
12 months due to her history of fever.
B) That after her acute illness subsided to consider checking
crp, esr and nuclear medicine studies if all else was negative;
and to also consider checking anaplasma/ehrlichia serologies,
anca, [**Doctor First Name **], spep/upep and consider Rheumatological evaluation +/-
Oncology evaluation.
.
5) Maculo papular rash: The patient developed a rash across her
abdomen, back and all 4 extremities 4 days prior to her
discharge. The rash was thought to be part of a possible drug
reaction to penicillins although the timing was after she had
discontinued her zosyn. It was treated with benedryl and sarna
and almost completely resolved by the time of discharge.
.
6) Increased mediastinal lymphadenpathy and 5mm lung nodule on
CT as noted above -  requires follow-up in [**4-30**] months.

Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred here from an outside hospital for
evaluation of pancreatitis and pneumonia. Your pancreatitis
improved without further intervention. Your pneumonia was
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. Your hospital course
was complicated by acute renal failure, which improved with IV
fluids. You had low-grade fevers until the end of your hospital
stay without a clear cause. You were  seen in consultation by
our Infectious Disease specialists who recommended several blood
tests for look for a possible infection that may be causing your
fevers. All of these tests were negative, including Hepatitis B,
HIV, and an RPR test. You have a pending test for Hepatitis C
that you can check at your follow up appointment. The infectious
disease doctors recommended that [**Name5 (PTitle) **] get an echocardiogram of
your heart, but your fevers have gone away before this test
could be scheduled in the hospital. You should follow up with
your primary physician to consider whether an echocardiogram
should be done as an outpatient. A small lung nodule was seen on
your CT scan of your lungs that will need to be followed up with
your primary physician.

There have been no changes to your home medications.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your primary care doctor within one week
of discharge.
