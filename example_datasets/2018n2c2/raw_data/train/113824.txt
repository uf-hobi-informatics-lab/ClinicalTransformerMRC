Blood smear [**6-13**]:
Numerous large monomorphic cells with very high N:C ratio,
minimal cytoplasm, multiple nucleoli, rare granules and no clear
auer rods.  Rare platelets, normal appearing RBC with occasional
nucleated RBC.

FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING [**2200-6-14**]
INTERPRETATION
Acute Myelogeneous Leukemia. Peripheral blood morphological
review shows high white counts, blasts with high N:C ratio,
irregular nuclear contours, very sparse granules. No Auer rods
seen. Given the absence of HLA-DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] CD34, while the morphology
does not support it, the flow profile does not rule out acute
promyelocytic leukemia. Correlation with cytogenetics and FISH
is recommended.

Cytogenetics Report [**2200-6-15**]
Culture of this specimen yielded no metaphase cells;
therefore, chromosome analysis could not be performed

FISH analysis with probes to the PML and RARA loci was
interpreted as NORMAL.

Imaging

Echo (pre-chemo) [**2200-6-15**]:
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and
global/regional systolic function.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2200-6-19**]
IMPRESSION:
 Evidence of ischemia in the right centrum semiovale following
the distribution
of the superior division of the sylvian MCA.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**2200-6-19**]
IMPRESSION:  No deep venous thrombosis in the right or left
lower extremity

TTE (Congenital, focused views) [**2200-6-20**]
This focused study demonstrates a patent foramen ovale with
small amount of right-to-left interatrial flow at rest.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2200-6-24**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Findings most consistent with typhlitis/neutropenic colitis,
given
patient's history.
2.  7 x 12 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule; given
substantial size,
follow-up CT is recommended within three months to show
resolution.  A small
nearby nodule can also be reassessed at that time.  Infectious
etiologies
could be considered or the nodule may incidental, though
substantial in size;
it would be an unlikely presentation of leukemia.  Right middle
lobe
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] process may represent early infection/inflammation.
3.  Small hypodensities bilateral renal cortices, too small to
characterize
fully.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2200-7-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Persistent cecitis and ascending colitis with persistent and
perhaps
slightly increased wall thickening and also greater inflammatory
fat
stranding.  The appearance suggests neutropenic colitis given
the patient's
history.

2.  Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, increased in the short
one-week interval since the prior study, worrisome for an
ongoing infectious etiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo F presenting with 2 weeks of increasing fatigue, mild
dyspnea, and recent low grade fever and dental abscess.  Given
lab findings, with elevated WBC count to 257K with 98% blasts,
found to have likely acute myelomonocytic leukemia, course of
7+3 chemotherapy complicated by stroke, typhlitis, neutropenic
fever, and likely fungal lung infection.

# Acute leukemia: Healthy 75F with 2-3 weeks of fatigue and
recent possible dental abscess s/p extraction [**6-5**] who presented
with elevated WBC >200K and anemia/thrombocytopenia discovered
at her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**6-13**]. She was admitted to the ICU for emergent
pheresis. In the [**Last Name (LF) 153**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] IJ central line catheter was placed
for pheresis given her WBC of 257 and risk for leukostasis.
After pheresis, her WBC count dropped to 127. She was also
started on hydroxyurea, allopurinol, and emperic cefepime for
chemo. After some discussions with the family she agreed to
chemotherapy and was transfered to BMT service for further
management. She underwent 7+3 cytarabine & idarubicin, course
was complicated by ischemic CVA on [**6-18**] found to have PFO & no
obvious source of thrombus, neutropenic colitis ([**2198-6-23**]),
likely fungal lung infection and neutropenic fever as discussed
below. After coming out of her nadir, patient had leukocytosis
to 20-30k, peripheral smear and flow showed mature monocytes,
possibly consistent with myelodysplasia or robust recovery, less
likely recurrence of leukemia or infection. Bone marrow biopsy
was not done for evidence of remission as patient does not wish
to have further chemotherapy, regardless of potential result.
-Patient will continue to follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] in clinic

#Sepsis/Febrile neutropenia:  Pt had low grade fevers on [**6-30**],
and fever to 101.7 @430 [**7-1**], afebrile at the time of transfer
[**7-2**]. Pt on broad spectrum abx coverage with [**Last Name (un) 2830**]/vanco. CT
chest/abd found new nodule in LLL that was increasing in size
suggesting infectious process. Sinus CT found possible
involvement of the right maxillary sinus.  ENT was consulted and
swab culture of the sinus was unrevealing.  Before being
transferred to the ICU for the second time during this
admission, she also developed hypotension with SBP in 80s after
receving ambisome.  She responded to fluid boluses and did not
require pressor support. At time, the hypotension was consider
to be mult-factorial including side-effect of ambisome as well
as underlying infection.  Cultures were negative. Pt was
continued on broad spectrum abx coverage. A CT chest/abd ([**7-1**])
found enlarging nodule in LLL, and sinus CT found possible
involvement of the right maxillary sinus with oral-antral
fistula. ID consult also followed patient during this admission.
- Per oral maxillofacial surgery there is no evidence of a
current dental abcess or dental infection
- All antibiotics except voriconazole were stopped and patient
was stable for two days prior to discharge.

# Syncope:  Syncopal episode [**2200-6-23**] likely secondary to
vasovagal or orthostatic hypotension.Pt had difficult ambulating
and required more assistance than normal. Now ambulating better
since starting PT.
-PT and OT therapy to continue since pt is still functioning
below baseline. Pt will continue to benefit from acute PT.

# Ischemic CVA - pt w/ new isolated L-sided mouth droop since
[**6-18**], neurology was consulted, MRI showed subtle area of ischemia
in centrum stemi ovale, extending into right insula (vascular
territory of R MCA), echo w/ bubble showed PFO, doppler of
bilateral LEs negative.
-Blood pressure control
-ASA 162mg daily started prior to discharge

#Rash: Patient had new erythematous non-pruritic maculopapular,
blanching rash on the back from the nape of neck to the T8-T9
dermatome. Concern was for leukemia cutis or fungal or drug
rash. Dermatology was consulted and believed the rash was
dependent erythema with early miliaria from recent fevers,
biopsy showed likely drug hypersensitivity reaction. Rash
resolved with removal of meropenem from regimen.

# Typhlitis/Neutropenic colitis: Pt found to have significant
bowel wall thickening and edema from cecum to hepatic flexture
consistent with typhlitis/ neutropenic colitis on [**2200-6-24**]. Pt
did not have abdominal pain but has reported some loose stools.
Broad spectrum coverage with aztreonam and flagyl until [**2200-7-14**],
was stable of antibiotic until discharge, ID followed. C. diff
was negative.

# Pulmonary nodule: [**Month (only) 116**] represent infection vs inflammation.
- Pt on aztrenonam, flagyl, vanco, ambisome
- concern since nodule size has increased in size over 1 week
period
- pt will need follow up CT in 3 months to f/u on nodule
- pt will follow in outpatient [**Hospital **] clinic, to determine length of
voriconazole treatment

Transitional Issues:
- pt will need follow up CT in 3 months to f/u on nodule
- goals of care: patient does not want more chemotherapy if she
has a recurrence

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 14664**],

It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**].  You came to the hospital because you
were tired, not feeling well and you were found to have a high
white blood cell count by your primary care physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] were
found to have acute myelogenous leukemia so you underwent
induction chemotherapy with (7+3) [**Doctor First Name **] + cytarabine. You
tolerated the chemotherapy well and your blood counts dropped as
expected.  You also experienced a stroke which resulted in a
left facial droop and left arm weakness.  A work-up for the
cause of the stroke revealed that you have a patent foramen
ovale, which is a hole between two [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] of your heart. In
addition you also developed neutropenic colitis which means that
the wall of your large intestines was inflammed which is a
complication of receiving chemotherpy.  We put you on
appropriate antibiotics to prevent an infection, rested your
bowels, and provide you nutrition via an IV line.  In addition
you also developed a rash which was a side effect of the
antibioitics you were taking. Your nutritional status improved
as did the infection in your bowels by the time you were
discharged.

The following changes were made to your medications:
START voriconazole for your fungal infection
START acyclovir to prevent viral infections
START two baby aspirin a day for your stroke
START metoprolol for your high blood pressure

Please keep your appointments as scheduled below.
