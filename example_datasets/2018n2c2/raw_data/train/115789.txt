Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
diffuse weakness, episodic numbness, diffuse body pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical pleurodesis and Left Upper Lobe Wedge Resection


History of Present Illness:
35 yo woman discharged from [**Hospital1 2025**] (admitted [**Date range (1) 32318**], then
[**Date range (1) 74351**]) s/p pleurodesis/VATS for bleb removal.  Pt. was
admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] from OSH with a L pneumothorax on [**8-22**], has a
chest tube placed, and on [**8-26**] had L flexible bronch, VATS, and
pleurodesis.  She tolerated the procedure well, with no
complications, and her pain was controlled with a Dilaudid PCA
-> Morphine PCA -> PO Dilaudid.  She was seen by the pain
service there and discharged on 2 mg Dilaudid PO Q4 per their
recs.  She was readmitted on [**9-1**] with a recurrent pneumothorax
and got a 2nd L sided chest tube.  She was discharged on [**9-7**] on
Dilaudid 2 mg PO Q8.
.
Pt. presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED [**9-7**] c/o diffuse weakness,
episodic numbness, diffuse body pain.  She was given 2 mg IV
Dilaudid in ED, 0.5 mg Ativan, and admitted to medicine for pain
control.  She was started on Amitriptyline however she never
received a dose. In the morning she was found to be complaining
of back pain and pain at the site of her chest tube placement.
She denied constipation, diarrhea or bowel incontinence, dysuria
or incontinence of urine, weakness or numbness, though she did
report "tingling" in her abdomen, and that she "can't feel bowel
movements coming out."  At 9PM that evening, she was found to be
unresponsive with a poor respiratory effort.  She was moving all
extremities spontaneously.  She was lethargic but appropriate 20
minutes before.  Initially her O2 sats were 70% on RA, HR 100,
SBP 160.  Her O2 sats improved to 94% on a face mask.  She had
clear breath sounds bilaterally.  She was intubated for airway
protection.  Her ABG was found to be 6.86/179/168/35/lactate
2.4.  Of note her WBC count increased to 22.4 with 78%
Neutrophils and 0% bands from 7.8 earlier today. She received
Narcan x1. She was transferred to the MICU.

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT, [**9-8**]: There is no pneumothorax. There is scarring
around a previous chest tube tract at the left lung apex. Linear
scarring is also present in the right and left lower lobes.
There is pleural thickening or small amount of pleural fluid at
the right lung base. Scattered blebs are present in both lungs.
The airways are patent to the level of segmental bronchi. There
is no mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy. There is no
evidence of hilar lymphadenopathy on non-contrast evaluation.
The heart and great vessels appear unremarkable. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
The visualized portions of the liver and spleen appear
unremarkable. There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions
in the visualized osseous structures.
.
IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax. Right basilar pleural thickening
versus a small pleural effusion.

CT CHEST

INDICATION: History of recurrent pneumothoraces, Guillain-[**Location (un) **]
syndrome,
pulmonary embolism with increasing left-sided chest pain.

Comparison is made to the prior chest CT dated [**2132-9-18**]
and prior
chest x-ray on the same day.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed
following
intravenous administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast.
Multiplanar
reconstructions were also obtained.

FINDINGS: Compared to the prior CT scan, there has been interval
development
of a large left-sided pneumothorax. This also appears to have
progressed
significantly compared to the chest x-ray performed on the same
day. There
are associated atelectatic changes in the left lung. There is
again evidence
of left upper lobe wedge resection. Multiple peripheral blebs
are noted along
the right upper lobe. Linear atelectatic changes are
demonstrated in the
right lower lobe with marked interval reexpansion of the right
lower lobe.
There has been development of an oval shaped roughly 3.8 x 2.1
cm
low-attenuation lesion in the right lower lobe with a few foci
of gas most
consistent with loculated fluid. The pulmonary arteries
demonstrate no
evidence of pulmonary embolism. The heart, pericardium, and
great vessels are
within normal limits. Note is made of a tracheostomy tube. An NG
tube is
also noted. No pathologically enlarged axillary, mediastinal, or
hilar lymph
nodes are demonstrated.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions.

CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: The above findings were confirmed with
multiplanar
reconstructions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of very large left-sided pneumothorax.
2. Marked interval reexpansion of the right lower lobe compared
to the prior
CT scan with residual small loculated fluid collection in the
right lower
lobe.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

Approved: SAT [**2132-9-27**] 9:06 AM
Procedure Date:[**2132-9-26**]

Clinical: Left recurrent pneumothorax.
Gross: The specimen is received fresh and labeled with the
patient's name, medical record number and "right upper lobe
wedge" and consists of three wedge resections of lung, the
smallest measuring 2.8 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm, the second measuring 3.6
x 1.2 x 0.6 cm, and the largest measuring 8.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm.
The pleural surface is smooth and without any gross
abnormalities. Serial sectioning reveals a red-brown spongy cut
surface without any lesions. The specimen is represented in A-C.

TWO VIEW CHEST, [**2132-10-16**] AT 14:51

COMPARISON: Previous study of earlier the same date at 8:24.

INDICATION: Status post removal of left-sided chest tube.

Since the recent chest radiograph, a left-sided chest tube has
been removed.
A small left apical pneumothorax is present, best visualized on
the lateral
view. In retrospect, this is also present on the pre-chest tube
removal
radiograph and is without interval change. On the PA view, the
pneumothorax
was partially obscured by the overlying chest tube on the
previous film,
rendering it more difficult to visualize prospectively. The
remainder of the
chest radiograph is without change since the recent radiograph.

IMPRESSION: Small left apical pneumothorax, stable in retrospect
compared to
pre-chest tube removal radiograph of earlier the same date.

Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2132-10-16**] 5:53 PM
Procedure Date:[**2132-10-16**]

INDICATION: 35-year-old woman with abdominal distention. Please
assess for
bowel obstruction.

COMPARISON: Abdominal radiograph dated [**2132-10-6**].

TECHNIQUE: AP supine and upright abdominal radiographs were
obtained.

FINDINGS: There is an NG tube which on [**2132-10-6**] had
shape
consistent with post pyloric position but now is coiled over the
left abdomen
presumably within the non-distended stomach. Small and large
bowel are of
normal caliber. Air is seen throughout loops of small bowel and
within the
proximal colon. There is no definite free air identified. There
are two 5 cm
metallic linear objects overlying the right abdomen with shape
consistent with
[**Doctor First Name **] pins and are likely external to the patient. There is
stable appearance
of bilateral breast implants. Bony structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction. NG tube with tip
previously in post-
pyloric position has now migrated back into the stomach.

Procedure Date:[**2132-10-10**]


Brief Hospital Course:
35 yo F with h/o spontaneous PTX, GBS, HIT induced PEs,
vent-associated pneumonia called out from the MICU [**10-1**].  Her
recent history is significant for 2 admissions to [**Hospital1 2025**]
([**Date range (1) 32318**]/05) for spontaenous left pneumothoraces.  On her first
admission, she had a left sided chest tube placed, a VATS, and
pleurodesis.  She tolerated this well and was discharged on PO
dilaudid for pain control.  She re-presented for her second
admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] with a recurrent pneumothorax, got a 2nd left
sided chest tube, and was again discharged on PO dilaudid.
After being dischraged from [**Hospital1 2025**] she presented the same day to
[**Hospital1 18**] complaining of diffuse weakness and body pain as well as
episodic numbness.  She was initially treated with pain control
with a morphine PCA per the pain service.  She continued to have
diffuse weakness, increasing anxiety and psychiatry was
initially consulted for ? conversion disorder.  On the evening
of [**9-9**] a code was called as she was unresponsibe with a poor
respiratory effort (HR 100, sBP 160, O2Sat 70% on RA --> 94% on
face mask).  An ABG revealed pH 6.86, pO2 168 pCOs 179).  She
was intubated and transferred to the MICU.

1st MICU course:
A neurology consult felt her elevated LP protein (112), diffuse
motor weakness, rapid time course, and rapid increase in her
peripheral WBC ([**8-8**]) were all consistent with GBS.  She was
started on plasmapheresis and received four sessions (fifth
session was not completed because pheresis line had to be pulled
due to positive HIT antibody).  She also developed ventilator
associated pneumonia for which she was treated with
vanco/levo/vanc for a 7 day course which was finished on [**9-17**].
She also developed heparin associated thrombocytopenia which
improved after d/cing all heparin products.  On [**9-18**], she had
increasing respiratory distress and increasing O2 requirements
and a CTA revealed pulmonary emboli found within all 3 segmental
branches of the RUL pulmonary artery.  Due to her positive HIT
antibody, she was started on argatroban and coumadin.  She was
switched to a trach mask on [**9-23**] and tolerated this and on [**9-25**]
was transferred to the floor.  The morning of [**9-26**] she developed
[**10-27**] stabbing, non-radiating, L sided chest pain.  Cardiac
enzymes were negative and a stat ECHO showed no WMA.  A CXR was
unremarkable but a CT scan showed a large L PTX and she was
transferred back to the MICU.

2nd MICU course:
Her INR was reversed and on [**9-30**] she had a mechanical
pleurodesis and LUL wedge resection.  No blebs were seen but
there was abnormal appearing lung tissue in the apex.  She was
transferred out of the MICU on [**10-1**].

1. Pneumothorax: unclear etiology of recurrent PTX.  Possibly
secondary to her stature.  alpha-1-antitrypsin was negative.
S/p L-sided wedge resection and pleurodesis on [**9-30**].  She had 2
chest tubes and one was removed [**10-6**], but [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] drain was left
in place.  The [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was removed on [**10-17**] after a
successful flamping trial.  She will follow up with CT surgery
in 1 week.

2. Pulmonary Embolism: She had a PE in all 3 branches of RUL
pulmonary artery on [**9-18**] CT scan.  Developed HIT with
plasmapheresis for GBS.  Restarted argatroban and coumadin [**10-1**]
following CT surgery.  She was initially on coumadin 2.5 mg PO
QHS and stable with an INR between [**2-21**].  Her INR started to
trend down, however, and her coumadin was adjusted to 3 mg PO
QHS.  Before discharge however, her INR started to trend up
slightly past 3, so she was discharged on 2.5 mg PO QHS.  Her
INR will be followed up by her PCP during her appointment later
this week.  He has been called regarding this.

3. Guillain-[**Location (un) **] Syndrome: She was s/p four cycles of
plasmapheresis (didn't get fifth cycle due to developing HIT).
Her tracheostomy was dwonsized on [**10-10**].  Trach was buttoned on
[**10-13**] and removed on [**10-14**].  On discharge, her stoma was almost
completely healed and well-granulated.  She will continue to
bandage it until completely healed (7-10 days from removal
date), and will cover it with cellophane for showering.  Her
strength returned over the course of her admission with daily
physical therapy.  On discharge, she was able to walk on her own
with a cane and to manage a couple flight of stairs.  She has a
follow-up appointment scheduled with neurology, and has the
phone number of interventional pulmonary should she have any
questions regarding her stoma.

4. Pain: Patient has pain secondary to her Guillain-[**Location (un) **] and
Pneumothorax.  Her PCA was discontinued once the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was
removed, and her pain was well controlled with a fentanyl patch
and oral morphine, which will be tapered as an outpatient.  She
will also continue neurontin 600 mg TID per neurology.  She was
not given oxycodone as she had a history of anaphylaxis to
percocet.

5. Anxiety: She has chronic anxiety which has been heightened by
recent course of events.  She was placed on her home dose of
standing ativan 0.5 mg PO Q6, and had several discussions with
social work and psychiatry nurses in-house.

6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia - L retrocardiac opacity that
has since rsesolved.  Sputhm from [**9-11**] with Haemophilus
B-lactamase negative.  She completed a 7 day course of Levo/Vanc
on [**9-17**].  She was afebrile with a normal WBC count on discharge.

7. Anemia - Her hematocrit was stable since her 2nd transfer out
of the MICU and her anemia was thought to be secondary to
frequent blood draws.  No evidence of an RP bleed by CT scan, no
evidence of hemolysis.  She was transfused with 2 units on [**10-8**].
 Her hematocrit had been stable for several days on discharge.

8. Abdominal pain - She developed intermittent abdominal pain
after her second transfer out of the MICU which required
placement of an NG tube with tube feeding.  Her abdominal pain
spontaneously improved to the point where the tube was removed
and she was tolerating a regular diet, and further improved once
she was told to take POs slowly and to avoid milk products.  She
was discharged tolerating a regular diet with no further
abdominal complaints.
