CXR [**12-3**]: FINDINGS: The patient is status post endotracheal
tube placement with the tip lying 3.0 cm above the level of the
carina. There are right base atelectatic changes. There are low
lung volumes. The lungs are clear with no evidence of pneumonia
or congestive heart failure. There is no evidence of pleural
effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal contours
are normal in appearance. The visualized osseous structures are
unremarkable. There are high-density ovoid structures projecting
over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen that could either
represent gallstones or may be extrinsic to the patient. Please
correlate clinically. IMPRESSION: 1. ET tube 3 cm above the
level of the carina. 2. Possible calcified gallstones.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented with lip and tongue swelling consistent
with angioedema in setting of ACEi use. She was intubated for
airway protection in the ED. Upon admission to the ICU, the
patient was started on pulse dose steroids, antihistamines and
H2 blockers around the clock. Her swelling rapidly improved and
she was successfully extubated within 48 hours. She was
evaluated by the allergy consult service who recommended C4 and
C1 esterase inhibitor levels which are pending at the time of
discharge. The patient was discharged on an oral prednisone
taper. She was transitioned off of her home ACEi in favor of
amlodipine for blood pressure control. She was also [**Month/Day/Year 1988**]
for outpatient allergy follow-up. The patient should avoid all
ACEi and [**Last Name (un) **] use in the future.

The patient was incidentally noted to have hilar lymphadenopathy
on CXR. Outpatient CT is recommended for further evaluation of
this finding.

She continues on albuertol for astham and oral contraceptives
for chronic uterine bleeding.
