Chief Complaint:
feeling unwell


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Internal Jugular Line placement

History of Present Illness:
66 yo m with DM, h/o CAD s/p CABG with PCI in '[**99**], severe PVD,
CKD, and s/p Vfib arrest who presents with 1 day of vague
symptoms.  He reports that he started feeling unwell yesterday
afternoon with nausea, lightheadedness, and some shortness of
breath.  He denies chest pain or pressure, palpitations,
vomiting, sweating.  He was noted to be altered by his wife with
concern re: difficulty speaking, perhaps a left sided facial
droop and possible left hemianopsia, but limited evidence for
this.  The patient denies having any difficultly speaking or
visual changes, but says that he was confused and seeing things
that weren't there.  His wife reported to the neurologist that
he never had a facial droop.
.
He reports chronic DOE, no CP at rest or with exercise, +
claudication (calf pain) with ambulating 2 blocks, denies
orthopnea, sleeps on 4 pillows at night.  + PND.  He reports LE
edema at baseline.  He lost 10 lbs over past 3 months, which he
attributes to diet and exercise.

He initially went to an OSH, where CT head was negative.  He was
found to have new [**Last Name (un) **] and elevated cardiac enzymes.  He was
hypotensive at OSH to SBP 80s, started on peripheral dopamine
and sent to the ED.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.9 86 94/45 on dopamine 20 95%.
He was also reporting worsening of chronic low back pain. His
exam was notable for [**3-11**] murmur, benign abdomen, rectal was
guaiac neg.  A bedside U/S in the ED was neg for pericardial
effusion.  Cardiology consult was requested for stat ECHO in ED,
to look for new WMA, but was not performed.  EKG was not felt to
be markedly changed from baseline.   There was some concern for
aortic aneurysm given back pain so he had a CT torso w/o
contrast, which was negative for aneurysm.  Vascular was
consulted and felt aortic dissection was unlikely.  Neurology
was consulted for concern re: TIA and they did not feel he had a
primary neurologic process.  Due to persistent hypotension, a
RIJ was placed and he was started on levofed.  He was not given
any antibiotics as he was afebrile without e/o infection.  VS
prior to transfer were 79 93/36 on levofed 0.12mcg, 18 99% on
3L.

Imaging:
carotid series: [**2204-4-9**]
1. Less than 40% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
2. 40-59% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
3. Reversal of flow in the right vertebral artery, suggestive of
subclavian steal.

Echo: [**2204-4-9**]
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %) with
global hypokinesis and apical akinesis. A left ventricular
mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. There is no ventricular septal
defect. with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion

CT abdomen/ pelvis: [**2204-4-8**]
1. normal caliber thoracic and abdominal aorta. no hematoma
detected.
Dissection cannot be detected due to lack of IV contrast.
2. Unusually large appendix (12 mm diameter) but no secondary
signs of
appendicitis. This may represent a mucocele, and elective
resection should be considered.
3. Hyperdense right renal mass may represent a hemorrhagic cyst,
but this is incompletely evaluated with this technique. This can
be further assesed with ultrasound.
4. No acute intrathoracic, intraabdominal, or intrapelvic
process seen.
5. Enlarged pretracheal lymph node.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo m with DM, h/o CAD s/p CABG with PCI in '[**99**], severe PVD,
CKD, and s/p Vfib arrest who presents with 1 day of vague
symptoms found to have hypotension, [**Last Name (un) **] and elevated CE.

# Shock/Hypotension: On arrival to the ED, patient's exam was
most consistent with cardiogenic shock, with a prior known EF
25-30%. He had no evidence of sepsis or hypovolemia on exam. His
hypotension was likely triggered by new administration of
minoxidil causing hypotension and stress leading to stress and
demand ischemia.  Home BP medications were held, and he was
started on levophed with a goal MAP of 55-60.  On admission to
the MICU, an a-line was placed for monitoring of his blood
pressures. Overnight in the MICU he required increasing doses of
levophed to maintain blood pressure. His CE were trended,
showing elevation of troponin and mild elevation in CK in
setting of acute kidney injury and demand ischemia.  Repeat Echo
showed stable EF of 25-30%, RV free wall hypokinesis and apical
akinesis. The patient was transferred to the CCU for further
management of cardiogenic shock.  Levophed was transitioned to
dopamine and patient was started on lasix gtt for diuresis with
good result.  Dopamine was weaned off on [**2204-4-11**].  Throughout
hospitalization, patient was maintained on therapeutic INR with
coumadin or with therapeutic PTT with heparin gtt given history
of recently diagnosed LV thrombus.  In setting of renal failure,
patient was started on carvedilol on [**2204-4-11**] and was not
restarted on atenolol. As an outpatient, the patient should be
restarted on [**Last Name (un) **] and spironolactone as tolerated by BP and
recovery of kidney function.

Of note, noninvasive blood pressures were difficult to monitor
on patient secondary to severe PVD.  Carotid dopplers showed
possible subclavian steal on right, so BP should be monitored on
left.

# Coronaries: Upon admission serial EKG showed nonspecific ST
changes in the lateral leads, that were initially concerning for
ACS.  Cardiac enzymes were trended, showing elevation of
troponin to 0.95 with only mild CK elevation in the setting of
worsened renal failure (see below) and cardiogenic shock.
Patient continued on ASA, plavix and atorvostatin through
duration of hospitalization.  Atenolol was held secondary to
renal failure and hypotension, and was later transitioned to
carvedilol once cardiogenic shock had resolved. Carvedilol dose
uptitrated to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] by time of discharge but other
anti-hypertensives were held since BP had been so low at
presentation and had not yet rebounded to previously elevated
levels.

# Acute Kidney Injury on chronic kidney disease: Patient
admitted with oliguric renal failure with Cr elevated to 5.0
from baseline of 2.6.  Likely etiology secondary to ATN in the
setting of his ongoing hypotension and poor forward flow.  Renal
was consulted for help with management given his possible need
for catheterization and severe renal dysfunction.  Kidney
function improved with initiation of dopamine and lasix gtt.
Home [**Last Name (un) **] and atenolol were held given worsened renal function.
Renal function was trended daily with creatinine peaking at 6.5.
 On discharge had improved to 3.8 and was trending in the right
direction but will be rechecked on Monday at Dr.[**Name (NI) 5452**] office.

# Altered mental status/reported neurologic changes: Presented
with vague neurologic complaints of confusion, dysarthria, and
facial droop which had resolved by presentation to the ED.
Initially the patient was noted to have some waxing - [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status thought to be secondary to toxic metabolic
encephalopathy from azotemia and cerbral hypoperfusion from
hypotension.  Neurologic exam was nonfocal and mental status
improved through hospital course.  Neurology was consulted and
felt that initial presentation was consistent with a TIA.  For
secondary prevention,  risk factor management was optimized and
patient constinued on strict control of hypercholesterolemia,
hypertension, and on antiplatelet agents. HA1C was found to be
10.6. Patient contined on coumadin to prevent embolic stroke
from known LV thrombus although this was held for a couple days
during hospitalization while there was concern that proceedure
might be needed as below.

# Known LV thrombus: Pt with history of LV thrombus documented
on prior TTE. Had been on warfarin as an outpatient but this was
held for a couple days as inpatient as concern that patient
would need additional invasive proceedures. Placed on heparin
gtt to cover while INR subtherapeutic. Warfarin was restarted 2
days prior to D/c and INR climbing but only up to 1.8 on day of
D/c so pt administered one sub-cutaneous dose of 80mg enoxaparin
on day of discharge and given script for one additional dose of
80mg enoxaparin the next day. Pharmacy was contact[**Name (NI) **] to confirm
that dosing should be 80mg daily for therapeutic
anti-coagulation in setting of improving renal failure.

# Transaminitis: New this admission, likely secondary to poor
forward flow given his presentation of hypotension.  Trended
through hospital course and noted to be downtrending.

# Diabetes: Type II on insulin, on 75/25 [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 387**]
recommendations.  Home regimen was held upon admission given
poor PO intake and patient transitioned to glargine + ISS.
Insulin regimen was adjusted to maintain blood sugars in
100-200. Ultimately put on NPH (70/30) regimen of 15 units in AM
and 15 units in PM with ISS to cover. Discharged on this
regimen.

# Incidental CT findings - noted incidentally on CT A/p. Large
appendix (12 mm diameter) but no secondary signs of
appendicitis, enlarged pretracheal lymph node and hyperdense
right renal mass that may represent a hemorrhagic cyst requires
outpatient surgical follow-up.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname **], you were admitted to the hospital with low blood
pressure and worsened kidney function. You initially were sent
to the cardiac ICU where medications were used to support your
blood pressure. You had a cat-scan of your abdomen to see if
there was something obstructing your kidenys. You received
contrast with this CT and medications after the CT to protect
your kineys from the contrast. Your warfarin was stopped for a
couple days because we thought you might need additional
proceedures with high risk of bleeding. We also stopped many of
your blood pressure medications because you had such a low blood
pressure initially. Your kidney function has improved and should
continue to improve and your blood pressure has come back up so
we have restarted some blood pressure medications. Your INR is
currently slightly less than 2 even though we have restarted
your warfarin so you will get a shot of lovenox today and give
yourself 1 shot of lovenox tomorrow to make sure your blood is
thin enough until you are seen in clinic on Monday. While you
were in the hospital there was also initially some concern that
you had a stroke. The neurologic service came to see you and
said you did not have a stroke but may have experienced what we
call a TIA with no residual symptoms.
You will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on Monday where you
will have your INR and electrolytes checked.

The following changes were made to your medications:
- Start carvedilol 25mg by mouth twice each day for blood
pressure
- Increase home furosemide to 80mg by mouth once each day for
fluid
- Start enoxaparin 80mg sub-cutaneously for 1 day (only take
this medication on Saturday, then stop)
- Your insulin coverage was changed to NPH 70/30 taking 15 units
in the morning and 15 units in the evening with a sliding scale
to cover your meal time insulin (see attached sheet)
- Continue your home Atorvastatin, warfarin, plavix, aspirin,
folic acid
- Stop all your other home medications for now until further
instructed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]: stop minoxidil, hydralazine, isosorbide
mononitrate, spironolactone, cilostazol, atenolol, benicar, your
former sliding scale.

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs. Please give yourself your enoxaparin shot on
Saturday as mentioned above. Please make sure to check your
blood sugars before each meal and give yourself the additional
insulin as instructed by the attached insulin slidding scale.

Followup Instructions:
You have a follow-up appointment scheduled on Monday [**2204-4-16**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. You will have your INR and electrolytes
checked at this visit.

You also have a follow-up appointment scheduled with your PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 11139**] on Thursday [**4-26**] at 12:30pm. At this
appointment you should discuss the findings of your CT scan
described below.

** While you were hospitalized, you received a CT scan of your
abdomen and pelvis to make sure there was no damage to your
kidneys. While your kidneys looked fine there were the following
findings which should be discussed with your PCP at next visit.
1. Unusually large appendix (12 mm diameter) but no secondary
signs of appendicitis. This may represent a mucocele, and
elective resection should be considered.
2. Hyperdense right renal mass may represent a hemorrhagic cyst,
but this is incompletely evaluated with this technique. This can
be further assesed with ultrasound.
3. Enlarged pretracheal lymph node.
