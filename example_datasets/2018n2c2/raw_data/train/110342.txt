CXR [**2193-7-27**]
IMPRESSION: Multifocal airspace opacities in the right upper and
lower lobes, concerning for active infection. With evidence
suggestive of prior TB, current active TB infection is not
excluded.

CT CHEST [**2193-7-28**]
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Peribronchovascular opacities in the right upper and middle
lobes most
suggestive of bronchopneumonia. Given history of TB and a partly
calcified
mass in the right upper lobe which could represent a large
granuloma, active tuberculosis is an important differential
consideration. Hemorrhage is another consideration.

2. Calcified nodule in the right lung (20 x 10 mm), probably
sequela of prior infection versus a tumor. CT follow-up is
recommended to resolution of opacities and surveillance of the
lung nodule within three months. If
available, comparison to prior studies could also be helpful.
PET scanning
could also be considered once the more acute process has
resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to the ED with a chief complaint of hemoptysis

# Hemoptysis - Chest film demonstrated multifocal opacities in
the RUL and RLL. Given the patient's prior history of TB and the
inability to exclude this on presentation, he was admitted to a
negative-pressure room.  On the floor, he remained
hemodynamically stable. He had three negative AFBs and was
removed from respiratory precautions. He had a CT scan on [**7-28**]
which showed peribronchovascular opacities and a 1cm x 2cm right
lung nodule felt to be chronic granuloma/prior infection
sequelae vs. malignancy. On [**7-29**], he again had moderate
hemoptysis and reportedly vomited blood and had black stools.
Pulmonary was consulted, and he was started on
Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin empirically for CAP on [**2193-7-31**].

Durnig his course, he had a recurrence of massive hemoptysis.
He was bronched on [**8-1**] and found to have substantial bleeding
from the posterior segment of right upper lobe. He then went to
IR and had embolization of the right bronchial artery and right
upper intercostal arterial branch. After the procedure, he was
intubated with a dual-lumen endotracheal tube to prevent
extravasation of blood into the left lung if bleeding recurred.
He remained stable and was extubated on [**8-2**]. Ceftriaxone was
replaced with Cefpodoxime on [**8-3**]. His pulmonary hemorrhage was
attributed to inflammation of prior eroded tissue from old TB,
with a new pneumonia as the precipitant.

# Elevated creatinine - He also had mild renal insufficiency
which was likely secondary to contrast nephropathy after the IR
procedure. The patient was transferred to the medical floor on
[**2193-8-3**], and his creatinine normalized with IV fluids and time.

He demonstrated continued clinical improvement, with small
amount of hemoptysis post-procedure.  He remained afebrile with
normal vital signs after transfer from the ICU.  He was
discharged on [**2193-8-4**] and will complete a 7 day course of both
azithromycin and cefpodoxime, to be completed on [**2193-8-6**].  He
will schedule a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] the week of discharge.

No other medications were started.

The patient is a full code.

hemoptysis

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after coughing up blood.  You
were treated for a pneumonia with antiobiotics.  Tests showed
that you did not have tuberculosis again.  You had another
episode of coughing up blood while in the hospital, and you had
a short stay in the intensive care unit.  At this time, a
procedure was performed to help stop the bleeding in your lungs,
which was successful.  You continued to do well after the
procedure, and you were discharged on [**2193-8-4**].

Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to set up an appointment this week. You
should discuss with him when to have another exam of your chest.
This exam of your chest should be within the next 3 months.

The following changes were made to your medications:
you were not taking any medications before you came to the
hospital.
you will continue taking two antibiotics:
cefpodoxime 200 mg twice a day for two days, finish on Tuesday
azithromycin 250 mg once a day for two days, finish on Tuesday

Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or 911 if you have red or black urine, if
you cough up large amounts of blood, if you have trouble
breathing, if you develop fevers, chills, or chest pain or any
other concerning medical symptoms.

Followup Instructions:
Please call your PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] J. [**Doctor Last Name **], at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8236**] to set
