Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7575**]
Chief Complaint:
More frequent seizures


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture


History of Present Illness:
This is a 51yo male patient with a h/o cerebral palsy, mental
retardation, grand mal seizures now presents with drowsiness and
increasingly frequent seizures complicated by a recent h/o
cough, dyspnea, bradycardia, and hypothermia.

In [**1-/2196**], developed a cough and drowsiness unaccompanied by
fevers, chills, or SOB, recieved Azithromycin and initially
improved. However, sometime after, his caretaker noticed he was
more drowsy, was drooling, had "congested" breathing sounds, and
the seizures were more frequent than the baseline [**3-17**]/month with
occasional myoclonic jerks. Apart from a transient diarrhea
which resolved after empiric Azithro, she reports that there are
no changes in his urine or stool.

EMS was called for dyspnea and on the way to the [**Hospital1 18**], he had
an episode of bradycardia to 39 for which he received 0.5mg of
Atropine, but he was not hypotensive. In the ED, he had a grand
mal seizure with extremities shaking x4 x1.5min and recieved
Ativan 1mg. He also had an episode of hypothermia T=89 and was
placed under a "bair hugger", received Ceftriaxone and Levoquin
for ?PNA or sepsis. He was also found with QT-prolongation and
AV-block on EKG in the ED.

He was admitted to the MICU, he was found with rhythmic right
shoulder jerks and a rolled back right eye and received Ativan
1mg - after which he went to sleep. Neurology was consulted for
AED mgmt, sz mgmt and altered mental status

UE (deltoids, biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, finger flexors

Pertinent Results:
Recent STUDIES:
[**2196-3-5**] CT NECK W/CONTRAST: Minimal fullness of the right
peritonsillar region, without discrete abscess or mass. Minimal
paranasal sinus mucosal thickening.
[**2196-3-4**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: Again noted is diffuse atrophy of
the brain parenchyma with prominence ventricles and sulci
essentially unchanged from prior studies. There is severe
atrophy
of the cerebellum, out of proportion to the cerebral atrophy.
There is no hemorrhage, acute large vascular territory infarct,
shift of midline structures or mass effect present. No fractures
are present and the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are well aerated. There is a left pthisis bulbi.
[**2196-3-4**] CXR: There are low lung volumes limiting evaluation.
The
visualized lungs show no effusions or pneumothorax. There is
bibasilar atelactasis, unchanged. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette appears unremarkable. The osseous structures are
intact


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 26010**] is a 51 year old man with a history of mental
retardation, cerebral palsy and epilepsy who presented with
likely sepsis with hypothermia, bradycardia and increased
seizure frequency.

NEURO:
The patient had a dilantin level of 28 and Carbamazepin level of
3. His increased seizure frequency was felt to be realted to
toxic dilantin levels and infection.  Over the course of this
hospitalization, his medications where redosed multiple times
and it was unclear what his home medications had been as there
where discrepencies in his record.  He was monitored on LTM
while in the ICU and until his medications where stable and
seizure frequency decreased.  His last seizure was on [**4-18**].
Since that time he came of off LTM and continued to do well with
no further seizures.  He was started on a low dose lamicatal to
be titrated slowly up as an outpatient.  From a neurological
standpoint his seiuzures have returned to baseline and he is
ready for discharge.

[**Known firstname **] was evaluated by physical therapy and felt to benefit
from rehabilitation.

ID:
There was initially no souce of infection identified on
admission.  Blood cultures grew Coagulase negative staph in [**4-17**]
bottles.  TTE was without evidence of no clear vegitations.
Although the blood cultures where felt to be a contaminant.  He
was treated with a course of vancomycin emperically after
discussion with ID.  All subsequent cultures after [**3-8**] where
negative.

PULM:
The patient was noted to have episodes of apnea while sleeping.
He may warrent evaluation for sleep apnea.

Social:
The patient was ready for discharge but had an extended hospital
stay secondary as he needed to go to rehab however the proper
guardianship was not in place.  This needed to be established by
court order.  Once this was done he was discharged to rehab.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Male First Name (un) 4542**] Nursing & Rehab

Discharge Diagnosis:
Suspected sepsis with hypothermia
Increased seizure frequency


Discharge Condition:
Returned to baseline:
Severe mental retardation, minimal interaction, vocabulary of 1
to 3 words
All extremities move against gravity and appear stronger but
difficult to assess due to inability to cooperate


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted following an episode of hypothermia, suspected
sepsis, and increased seizure frequency.  You were observed in
the medical ICU for 6 days, with multiple rounds of viral and
bacterial cultures.  No causative organism was ever found.  You
were treated with broadspectrum antibiotics throughout this
period. You had blood cultures positive for coag negative strep,
which is most consistent with contamination and not a true
positive finding.  Regardless, you received sufficient
vancomycin to cover this organism in the unlikely event that it
represented a true infection.

During this period of suspected sepsis your seizure frequency
was noted to be higher than baseline.  We have adjusted your
anti-seizure medications during the hospitalization.  You have
been very stable and your last seziures was [**2196-4-18**].  You are
currently stable on the medications as follows:

Carbamazepine 400mg/600mg am/pm
Keppra 1500mg/2000mg am/pm
Phenytoin 150mg/100mg am/pm

and you were started on Lamictal 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
which will be increased by 25mg every week until you
are on a dose of 150mg [**Hospital1 **]

Please make all follow up appointments.  If you have an increase
in seizure frequency please ensure the patient's doctor is
notified.
