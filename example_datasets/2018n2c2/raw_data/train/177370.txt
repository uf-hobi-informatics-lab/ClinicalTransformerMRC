Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5123**]
Chief Complaint:
Rash/Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
51 year old female h/o metastatic melanoma s/p ICH and placement
of VP shunt presented [**1-24**] with fever and rash. On [**1-2**]
patient had left hemiplegia and HA, was diagnosed with ICH from
metastatic melanoma.  Underwent emergent craniotomy for
evacuation of bleed and tumor rescetion, she was also started on
dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. She then developed
hydrocephalus and had VP shunt placed on [**1-6**] and repeat VP
shunt operation on [**1-14**] secondary to her failure at clamping
trials. Prior to discharge she was noted to be febrile to 103 on
[**11-13**] temp spiked to 101.5 with a productive cough,
influenza was negative so she was discharged on levofloxacin,
completed course [**1-21**]. Three sets of blood cultures and urine
culture negative.  She also developed a diffuse morbiliform
eruption rash after dilantin was started.  However, Dilantin was
continued since the benefits of sizure prophylaxis outweighed
risks of continuing medicaitons.  After discharge her fever
resolved but the rash did not.  She used Sarna lotion and
benadryl at home, but noted spread of the rash from truck
outwards to extremities, sparing face palms and soles.
.
On day of admission ([**1-23**]) she developed a high fever with
chills and was brought to [**Hospital3 3583**], and was then
transfered here for further care.  Upon arrival to the ED the
patient recieved 125 mg
Solumedrol, 50 mg IV Benadryl, 1 gram tylenol, Motrin 800 mg and

4 liters of normal saline. Her fever initially was >104.8
rectally (107 temporal) but trended down to 99.1.  Got CXR,
cultures, urine and shunt tapped.  ID was consulted who
recommended holding on Abx given lack of source, did not feel
that VP fluid cell count was indicative of shunt infection, more
likely blood.  Dermatology was also consulted.

Imaging:
CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT head:
1. Interval evolution of encephalomalacia and decrease of blood
products at prior sites of hemorrhage.
2. Slight increase in right frontal subdural low density
collection.
3. Stable ventriculostomy catheter location with no interval
development of hydrocephalus.
4. No new site of hemorrhage.
5. 4-mm leftward midline shift.

CT abd/pelv:
1. Interval VP shunt placement, with no adjacent fluid
collection. No
evidence of acute intra-abdominal process.
2. Left adrenal adenoma, unchanged.
3. Small amount of pelvic free fluid, fluid in the endometrial
cavity, and a small amount of air in the bladder may relate to
recent LEEP procedure.
4. Increase in size of left buttock subcutaneous nodule, highly
concerning for metastatic disease in this patient with known
melanoma.
5. Right paramedian Bartholin gland cyst with tiny dependent
stone; less likely urethral diverticulum.

EKG: Sinus tach

Brief Hospital Course:
Initially transferred to MICU for closer monitoring for
development vessicles/bullae or mucosal involvment.  Stable
overnight.  Developed fever to 104 following morning with HR in
the 130s, which improved with fluids, acetaminophen and motrin.
Dilantin held and Keppra started for seizure [**Last Name (LF) 9401**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 724**].

#Rash: Most likely hypersensitivity reaction (DRESS) from
dilantin vs famotidine.  Both were held.  Concerned for SJS
initially, however rash did not appear to involve mucosa or
palms/soles, and no bullae.  Also considered toxic shock
syndrome initially w/ fever and rash, but no tampon use.  No
evidence of meningitis given neck supple, no headache, CSF fluid
does not appear infected, no fluid around abdominal portion of
VP shunt. Seen by dermatology who recommended clobetasol,
hydrocortisone cream, steroids as well as benadryl, Sarna and
atarax.  Rash remained stable, not spreading and perhaps slighty
improving. Her fever decreased and she was able to tolerate PO.
LFTs trending down, Cr stable, but she had a persistant
eosinophilia. Per derm, rash likely to last for several weeks
prior to resolution.  Will follow up with dermatology as an
outpatient.
.
#Fever: Most likely drug reaction.  Infection considered,
however no localizing signs of infection and no sick contacts.
Cultures negative.  No Abx given. Flu negative. Given
acetaminophen and motrin as well as IVF. Temperature trended
down and had normalized at time of discharge.
.
# Tachycardia: Persistant in 90-100s, fluid responsive,
improving when afebrile.  Likely [**3-15**] insensible losses from
fever and rash.  Encouaged PO fluids on discharge, fever control
and close followup.
.
#Malignant melanoma: s/p ICH w/ multiple mets to brain. No
current e/o neurologic defict other than left facial droop
likely residual from previous ICH.  Will follow up as
outpatient.

Secondary Diagnosis:
Metastatic Melanoma


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status:Clear and coherent
Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive
Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent


Discharge Instructions:
You were seen in the hospital for a fever and rash that is
likely due to the dilantin you were prescribed for seizure
propalaxis.  You were evaluated by the dermatology team and
given steroids and medication to decrease itching.  It is
important to drink lots of fluids to avoid dehydration with your
fever.  The rash might worsene before it gets better and it is
possible your skin will slough off as it heals.

You should STOP your dilantin.  Instead take Keppra as
prescribed for seizure prophalaxis.  You were given
prescriptions for steroids and anti-itch cream that you should
take as directed.
