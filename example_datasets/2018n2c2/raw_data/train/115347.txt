EGD ([**2147-5-8**])
Esophagus:
Lumen: A complex, sliding, medium paraesophageal hernia was
seen.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Excavated Lesions. A single cratered ulcer was found
in the duodenal bulb. A clot suggested recent bleeding. 4
cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] hemostasis with success. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP
Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully. A single
superficial ulcer was found in the distal bulb. A visible vessel
suggested recent bleeding. 4 cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] hemostasis
with success. A hemoclip was then applied to the visible vessel.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course: 2 large-bore IVs were placed. The pt's ASA, BB,
ACEi and Lasix were held. She had no further BMs or melena. She
remained HD stable with SBP in 110s and HR in 70s after initial
2L NS bolus. She was transiently on a PPI drip and was
transfused a total of 4U with HCT coming up to 27 from 18. Her
HCT remained stable after these initial 4 units.
.
GI did not feel that the pt was still actively bleeding, thus no
urgent scope was performed in the MICU. She was switched to PPI
IV bid and started on clears which she tolerated well. The pt
was transferred to the medicine floor for further management.
.
Floor Course:
# GI bleed: The pt required a total of 7 units pRBCs to maintain
her HCT over her hospital course. She had an EGD performed by GI
which demonstrated a single cratered ulcer in the duodenal bulb
with stigmata of recent bleeding. This was injected with
epinephrine and clipped; GI indicated that a risk of rebleeding
remained. The pt was treated with a Protonix gtt for >48 hours
and then transitioned to PO therapy [**Hospital1 **]. The pt's HCT was stable
for the remainder of her [**Hospital 62681**] hospital stay at
around 27 to 28. The pt's antihypertensives were held in this
setting and her blood pressure was well-controlled with only
diltiazem. The pt's home aspirin was held.
.
# A-fib/SVT: At the time of admission, the pt was taking ASA 325
[**Hospital1 **] for her prior history of PAF; this was stopped at the time
of admission. In the setting of having her beta blocker held,
the pt was noted to have several episodes of AF with RVR (HR to
the 140s), as well as two episodes of SVT (HR again to 140s)
that was thought to likely represent AVNRT. All of these
episodes were asymptomatic for her and she remained HD stable. A
TSH and CXR were checked and were unremarkable. Although the
pt's HR responded well to re-initiation of her beta blocker,
this did not suppress her SVT, and thus her beta blocker was
transitioned to PO diltiazem. At the time of discharge, she had
not had any SVT for 24 hours. We would suggest possible
up-titration of her diltiazem as allowed by her HR and BP, and
eventual conversion to the long-acting form of the medication.
.
# Diastolic dysfunction: The pt appeared euvolemic throughout
her stay. A chest x-ray after several days without Lasix did not
demonstrate any evidence of failure. A echo in [**2145**] demonstrated
preserved EF and mild AR. As above, the pt's ACEi, beta blocker
and lasix were held at admission; ***these may need to be
restarted in the future.***
.
# CAD: The pt had a negative stress-MIBI in [**2145**]. Her ASA was
held throughout her hospital stay as described above. When her
HR was elevated, the pt was noted to have fairly diffuse ST
depressions which resolved with better HR control, thus
continued aspirin therapy, likely at 325 mg daily, would be
ideal. This was deferred at the time of discharge so that the
pt's HCT could be followed for another 1-2 weeks.
.
# Dementia: The pt remained pleasantly and mildly demented
throughout her hospital course. There was no evidence of
delirium.

Discharge Instructions:
-You were admitted with bleeding in your GI tract that was
caused by an ulcer. We have treated you with blood transfusions,
applied clips to the blood vessels in your ulcer and are giving
you medications to help prevent a recurrence. You are being
discharged to rehab before going home to help regain your
strength.
-It is important that you continue to take your medications as
directed. We made the following changes to your medications
during this admission:
--> Aspirin was held because of bleeding. Talk with your doctor
about when or if to restart this.
--> Your home metoprolol was changed to diltiazem. This is a
similar medicine that we think will do a better job of
controlling your heart rate.
--> Your Lasix was stopped because your blood pressure was
normal. Please talk with your doctor about when to restart this.
--> Your lisinopril was stopped because your blood pressure was
normal. Please talk with your doctor about when to restart this.
-Contact your doctor or come to the Emergency Room should your
symptoms return. Also seek medical attention if you develop any
new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea,
vomiting or unusual stools.

Followup Instructions:
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5351**] is aware that you have been discharged from the
hospital. Her office will contact you to arrange follow-up in
the next few days. Please call her office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 608**] if you
have not heard from them by then.
