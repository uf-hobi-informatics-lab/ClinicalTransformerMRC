Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5569**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain and fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy ([**2180-9-11**])


History of Present Illness:
31yoF with h/o IVDA, cirrhosis [**1-19**] autoimmune hepatitis c/b
portal HTN w/ ascites, variceal bleed s/p TIPS on [**2180-7-17**], and
hepatic encephalopathy, as well as hyperglycemia [**1-19**] TIPs and
steroids represents with abd pain. Of note, the patient was just
admitted Thurs->Friday for N/V/abd pain. During that admission,
she had a CT scan which showed no cause for her pain.
Gastroenteritis was presumed and she was discharged home after
her symptoms improved with zofran and dilaudid.
.
She reports that after discharge on Friday, she felt well. Then,
this morning ~ 5 AM, abd pain woke her from sleep. The pain was
diffuse, sharp and intermittent. She was able to get back to
sleep after 45 minutes. Then, when her mom woke her to check her
fsbg ~ 10, she again noticed the abd pain. She slept most of the
day, but did have 1 episode of nbnb emesis and felt persistently
nauseated. She also took her temperature during the course of
the day and it trended from 101 to 99.0. Her mother thought she
should go to the hospital because of the pain and vomiting so
she went to Addison-[**Doctor Last Name **].
.
At OSH ED, she received zofran 4 mg, dilaudid 1 mg x 3, and 1L
NS. Her pain improved. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because she
was concerned she needed imaging, which couldn't happen quickly
there. At [**Hospital1 **] ED, initial VS 99.9 82 109/57 14 99% on RA. First
set of labs was inaccurate. 2nd set of labs significant for
baseline pancytopenia, Na 137, Cr 0.6, and INR 2.2 (bl = 1.8)
(though INR was from first draw). LFTs were near baseline. RUQ
U/S showed cirrhotic liver, stable splenomegaly, unchanged
gallbladder wall edema and new to-and-fro flow in the left
portal vein. She was given 2L NS, 0.5 mg IV dilaudid x2, and 4
mg IV zofran. Stool guaiac was negative.
.
Currently, VS 97.4 126/74 87 20 100% on RA. She states that she
feels much better now though still has [**5-26**] diffuse, sharp abd
pain. Her nausea has resolved and she ate 2 box meals in the ED
today. She says that she feels silly to have come to the ED
again with most of the tests being negative and asks if she is
expected to have abd pain/nausea/vomiting with her disease. She
wasn't sure whether or not she should have come to the hospital
and didn't know who to call to ask.
.
ROS: + low-grade fevers, abd pain, n/v, fatigue
Denies night sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea,
congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain,
constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.
.
Finally, this patient has had a complicated course over the past
3 months. Briefly, she was admitted on [**6-12**] for a GI bleed -
grade 1 varices without bleeding seen on EGD. She represented on
[**7-1**] again with GI bleeding - EGD showed non-bleeding varices,
gastritis, and portal gastropathy. She was admitted again on
[**7-12**] for a third GI bleed - this admission she had TIPS
procedure performed. Course was complicated by high-grade MRSA
bacteremia requiring 6 weeks of IV vancomycin (at rehab, d/t
concern of IVDA and PICC line). She was then admitted from rehab
on [**8-8**] for hepatic encephalopathy and again on [**8-25**] for hepatic
encephalopathy and hyperglycemia.

DIAGNOSTICS:
DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL [**2180-9-9**]
DUPLEX DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF THE LIVER: The liver demonstrates
heterogeneous
echogenicity, findings consistent with patient's known history
of cirrhosis.
No focal hepatic lesion is identified. The visualized portions
of the
pancreatic head, neck, and body are within normal limits.
Evaluation of the
tail is limited by overlying bowel gas. The spleen remains
enlarged measuring
15.7 cm. There is unchanged diffuse gallbladder wall edema,
findings
consistent with patient's underlying chronic liver disease.
However, no focal
gallstones are visualized. The common bile duct measures 5 mm
and is not
dilated. There is a mild amount of perihepatic and left upper
quadrant
ascites, which is new compared to prior ultrasound though
similar compared to
recent CT examination.

LIVER DOPPLER: Color and pulse wave Doppler examination of the
hepatic
vasculature demonstrates a patent main portal vein with a peak
systolic
velocity of 44 cm/sec compared to 59 cm/sec on recent prior. The
TIPS is in
unchanged position with wall-to-wall flow throughout and typical
respiratory
variations. The velocity in the proximal TIPS ranges from
167-196 cm/sec
compared to 150-190 cm/sec on recent prior. The range of
velocities in the
mid TIPS ranges from 144-164 cm/sec, decreased compared to prior
when it
measured 177-231 cm/sec. The peak systolic velocity in the
distal TIPS
measures 134 cm/sec compared to 121 cm/sec on the prior. The IVC
is patent
with usual directional flow. The left portal vein demonstrates
some to- and
fro- flow which appears new compared to prior examination,
though centrally
flow is in the direction of the TIPS. The main hepatic artery
demonstrates
normal arterial Doppler waveform with a peak systolic velocity
of 85 cm/sec.

IMPRESSION:
1. Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow and respiratory
variability. Stable
velocities in the proximal and distal TIPS with slightly
decreased velocities
in the mid TIPS compared to recent prior examination.
2. Newly identified to and fro flow within the left portal vein,
though
centrally flow appears hepatofugal towards the TIPS stent.
3. Stable cirrhotic-appearing liver, diffuse gallbladder wall
edema and
splenomegaly.
4. Small amount of perihepatic and left upper quadrant ascites,
which is new
compared to prior ultrasound though similar compared to recent
CT examination.

PERTINENT LABS ON DISCHARGE:


Brief Hospital Course:
31 y.o. F with h/o IDDM, IVDA, cirrhosis [**1-19**] autoimmune
hepatitis c/b portal HTN w/ ascites, variceal bleed s/p TIPS on
[**2180-7-17**], and hepatic encephalopathy, presented with abd pain and
occult anemia. Hct drop from 24 to 21. PRBC transfusion was
given.  She underwent endoscopy on [**2180-9-12**] complicated by a GI
bleed when a previously placed coil in the duodenum became
dislodged. The pt's Hct dropped to 16.9 and she was taken to IR
to embolize the bleeding duodenal varix and subsequently
transferred to the CCU.

Transplant surgery was consulted and on [**2180-9-13**] she was taken to
the OR for exploratory laparotomy, ligation of duodenal varix,
duodenotomy, and retrieval of embolic coils. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was
placed. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Please refer to operative
note for details.

Postop course was complicated by high ascites drain output
requiring IV fluid replacements and albumin. Diet was slowly
advanced. Lactulose and Rifaximin were started to prevent
encephalopathy. She had high pain med requirements for
persistent abdominal pain. Drain fluid was sent for cell count
and culture on [**9-22**]. Culture of fluid isolated 2 species of
Acinetobacter Baumanii pan-sensitive except Bactrim. She was
started on Cetriaxone. Fluid was re-sent on [**9-25**] demonstrating
94 WBC and 21 polys. Culture was negative.

On postop day 13, she was re-started on Lasix and Aldactone. On
postop day 14, the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was removed. Incision and old
drain site remained dry. However, abdominal girth increased.
Creatinine started to rise.

On [**9-29**], a liver donor offer was available. Patient accepted
and underwent Liver Transplant. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
Please refer to operative note for details. She was sent to SICU
immediately postop for management where she was extubated. LFTs
increased as anticipated. Liver US/Duplex demonstrated patent
arteries with resistive index in the right hepatic artery  0.7
to 0.78,  main hepatic artery was 0.78 to 0.79, and left hepatic
artery was 0.68. The middle, right, and left hepatic veins were
patent with normal waveforms. The main, right anterior, right
posterior and left portal veins are patent with normal
waveforms. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation was seen. Repeat liver duplex was unchanged. LFTs
trended down.

Creatinine continued to rise to 3.2 then decrease. Lasix was
given for generalized edema.

Diet was advanced and tolerated. Insulin gtt was initially
started then switched to sliding scale. She remained
hemodynamically stable and was transferred out of the SICU.

LFTs decreased. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and Lantus with sliding
scale ordered.  She was assisted out of bed to ambulate. Pain
medication was switched to po Dilaudid. Dose was increased for
c/o abdominal pain. Lateral JP was removed on [**10-3**] and site
sutured. This remained dry. On [**10-9**], a liver biopsy was
performed for rising alk phos. Biopsy demonstrated bile duct
proliferation. An ERCP was then done on [**10-11**] noting CBD
stricture; duct was stented. Alk phos decreased after stenting.
She tolerated the procedure fairly well. She complained of
abdominal pain and severe headache. She was also hypertensive.
This was treated with IV Lopressor and IV Morphine. Head CT was
normal. Norvasc was stopped for potential etiology of headache.
Headache and abdominal pain resolved.

Immunosuppression consisted of Cellcept which was well
tolerated, steroids were tapered per protocol. Prograf was
initiated and doses adjusted. The plan was for Prednisone to
continue permanently after taper for Autoimmune hepatitis. Lasix
was continued for 2+ leg edema. Creatinine normalized.

She was cleared by PT for home safety and was discharged to her
mother's home with VNA services. She demonstrated good knowledge
of medications and insulin management.

Of note, she experienced developed diffuse itching and burning
of the skin
and sensation of shortness of breath after eating a peanut
butter [**Location (un) 6002**].  She was given Benadryl for this and was
evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2602**] Sheik, who felt that she could have
acquired  passive transfer of food specific IgE antibodies with
a organ transplant. She was instructed to avoid all peanut
products strictly for the next month and/or until seen in
[**Hospital 9039**] Clinic in followup. Serum specific IgE to peanuts and
other common food allergens were sent, and she was given an
EpiPen script on discharge.  Administration technique was
provided. She will followup in the outpatient [**Hospital 9039**] Clinic n
two to four weeks.  Results of blood tests were to be reviewed
at that time.
