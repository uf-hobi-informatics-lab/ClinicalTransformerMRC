Chief Complaint:
Cough, SOB, fever

History of Present Illness:
40 yo M with in his usual state of good health presents with
fever to 103, cough, and shortness of breath. His initial
symptoms were fever and myalgia, beginning abruptly on Friday
morning. He subsequently developed cough. On the morning of his
admission, he developed palpitations and presented to a hospital
in [**Location 3615**], where he was found to be in rapid atrial
fibrillation. From there, he was transported to [**Location (un) 9101**], where
he was treated with normal saline, vancomycin 1 gm, azithromycin
500 mg, ceftriaxone 1 gram, digoxin 0.25 mg, ibuprofen 600 mg,
acetaminophen 975 mg, diltiazem 20 mg IV, and Cardizen CD 120
mg. His heart rate was controlled, but he developed a new oxygen
requirement and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

At [**Hospital1 18**], CXR showed a right-sided pneumonia with parapneumonic
effusion. He was continued on a diltiazem gtt at 10 mg/hr. Blood
and sputum cultures were sent. He was admitted to the ICU on a
non-rebreather.

DISCHARGE LABS:

Imaging:
[**7-6**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for right lower lobe
pneumonia and possible right pleural effusion with atelectasis.
Left base retrocardiac opacity could be due to atelectasis
although a second location of consolidation/infection not
excluded. Additionally, subtle opacity at the lateral left mid
lung, while could relate to overlying soft tissue, additional
focus of consolidation is not excluded.

[**7-7**]: CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion is stable. On
the left, an area of
parenchymal opacity, previously qualified as potential
pneumonia, has
increased in extent. There is a newly occurred small reactive
left-sided
pleural effusion with subsequent left atelectasis. The diameter
of the
pulmonary vessels is minimally increased, potentially reflecting
mild fluid overload.

[**7-7**] CTA: 1. Widespread rapidly evolving multilobar pneumonia,
possibly complicated by ARDS.
2. Small bilateral simple layering pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION:
40 yo M presents with fever, shortness of breath, and cough,
admitted to MICU for hypoxemia requiring NRB, found to have
trilobar PNA.

ACUTE DIAGNOSES:
# Multilobar Pneumonia, likely bacterial: CTA results showed
significant tri-lobar PNA which appeared significant enough for
shunting to explain his degree of hypoxia. His PNA was treated
and oxygen was weaned down and he tolerated walking around floor
with nasal cannula, though he wore face tent at baseline for
comfort. He was initially treated for CAP but because he works
in a health-care setting and considering the extent of PNA with
hypoxia he was treated for HCAP coverage with IV vancomycin,
cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. On the floor he quickly weaned down
to room air and was breathing comfortably with occasionally
sputum tinged with blood. He was discharged on a 10-day course
of levofloxacin & linezolid, to cover ensure coverage of both
MSRA and other usual CAP organisms.

#Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Dr. [**Known lastname 23**] initially presented
in new onset A.Fib with runs of RVR into 160s with associated
hypotension. He was treated with a 10mg/hr Dilt drip and
spontaneously converted to sinus and he remained in sinus rhythm
throughout the rest of his hospitalization. Although he has a
history of palpitations in the past (and has been on a Holter
monitor), this is his first episode of atrial fibrillation.
Given his CHADS2 score of 0-1 it was felt that he did not
require anything other than a daily aspirin (which he has been
taking as an outpatient).  The aspirin was held due to
intermittent hemoptysis/blood streaked sputum, but Dr. [**Known lastname 23**]
was advised to discuss reinitiation of aspirin as an outpatient.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: None.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Follow-Up: The patient was instructed to follow up with his
new primary care doctor within 1-2 weeks.  He was told to
discuss reinitation of aspirin with his PCP when his hemoptysis
ceases.  He should also be screened for hypertension, as it was
noted that his blood pressure was elevated to the 140s-150s
systolic while he was on the floor.

had a multifocal pneumonia.  You were treated with
broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, which were transitioned to PO
antibiotics a day prior to your discharge.

- Medications ADDED: Guaifenesin-CODEINE cough syrup as needed

Followup Instructions:
We are working on a follow up appointment in [**State **]Group with your new primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
