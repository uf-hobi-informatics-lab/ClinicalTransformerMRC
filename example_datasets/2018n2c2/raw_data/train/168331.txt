Chief Complaint:
increased shortness of breath and worsening dysphagia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tracheostomy, PEG placement, IVC filter placement, peptic ulcer
cauterization

History of Present Illness:
50 yo M Spanish speaking quadraplegic male with h/o ALS related
muscle weakness and worsening respiratory failure s/p multiple
hospital admissions for worsening weakness and FTT who presents
from home w/ continued chronic complaints of weakness,
difficulty eating, and intermittent shortness of breath. He
denies any new complaints in the last 5 months. He has had
intermittent SOB and intermittent O2 requirement at home. He has
had continued problems with eating.  Food gets stuck in his
throat when eating. He also complains of intermittent nausea.
He is wheelchair bound at home. He was last admitted
[**Date range (3) 50217**] for FTT, nausea and decreased po intake. At that
time, neurology recommended hospice care because of frequent
admissions for failure to thrive. It was also recommended that
he have acute rehab placement rather than a discharge home as it
seemed he needed more help at home. However patient refused and
was discharged home with VNS.
.
In ED, was febrile to 101. CXR and U/A were unremarkable. Blood
cultures were drawn. Given total of 3L NS in ED. He states he
has not received any of his medications today. On the floor, he
is comfortable and smiling. He denies and chest pain, abdominal
pain, vomiting, dysuria, changes in his stools, fever, chills.

OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION
Date: [**2187-8-29**]
Signed by [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **], CCC,SLP on [**2187-8-29**]  Affiliation:
[**Hospital1 18**]

EVALUATION:
An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed
today in collaboration with Radiology.  Thin liquid,
Nectar-thick
liquid, and pureed consistency barium were administered. He
refused to try a ground consistency. The exam was performed with
him seated fully upright at 90  w/the Passy-Muir Valve in place
over the trach.  Results follow:

SUMMARY:
Significant worsening of his oral and pharyngeal swallowing
ability s/p trach placement compared with his videoswallow on
[**2187-8-9**].  He is now having penetration with straw sips of thin
and nectar thick liquid and aspiration with straw sips of thin
liquid.  Aspiration is "silent" or without coughing.  He can not
clear the aspirated material with a cued cough. He has residue
in
his valleculae even when he alternates between bites of puree
and
sips of nectar.  He refused to try a ground consistency.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  It is not possible to eliminate the aspiration risk if he
    takes PO's.  However, we can reduce the risk.  Head position
    is critical to adequate airway protection.  He must be
    propped up with his head at 90 to fully protect his airway,
    and the Passy-Muir speaking valve must be in place over the
    trach.  He reported difficulty breathing by with the PMV on

    by the end of our study despite 02 sats of 98%.  His
    respiratory rate was 31 by the end of the exam and it
    dropped back to 24 after removal of the PMV.

2.  The safest way to feed him with the least aspiration risk:
    A.  Sit fully upright w/head propped forward at 90
    B.  Cup sips of nectar thick liquid
    C.  Alternated with bites of pureed foods
    D.  Only when wearing the PMV
    e.  Only after thorough suctioning prior to any PO's

3.  If he is made CMO and he wants water, we would suggest
    Thorough suctioning & complete oral care w/mouthwash first
    then cup sips of ice water only when fullu upright w/PMV on

4.  If he is unable to wear the PMV, we should repeat the
    videoswallow without it to see if he is still safe to take
    PO's without the PMV.

These recommendations were shared with the patient, the nurse
and
the medical team.

Surgeon:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**MD Number(1) 33887**]

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with
1) respiratory failure, 2) nutritional failure.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with
1) respiratory failure, 2) nutritional failure.

PROCEDURE:
1.  Tracheostomy.
2.  Gastrostomy.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the
operating theater and his neck, chest and abdomen were
prepared with Betadine and draped sterilely. The head was
positioned extended with shoulder roll placed. The
tracheostomy incision was performed first with the remainder
of the field isolated with an over drape.

A vertical midline incision was formed in the neck between
the cricoid and the sternal notch. This was infiltrated with
1% lidocaine with epinephrine for improved hemostasis. The
wound was taken down in the midline using cautery taking care
to remain in the raphae. The anterior surface of the trachea
was crossed at the first interspace by the thyroid isthmus.
The isthmus was therefore isolated and suture ligated
bilaterally with #2-0 silk. It was then divided and the
second and third tracheal rings exposed widely by dissection
of the thyroid off of the trachea. At this time, stay sutures
were placed into the trachea in the midline at the first and
third rings with 3-0 Prolene. A trap door was scored with
cautery and then the trachea was entered sharply with the
endotracheal balloon deflated. The transverse incision at the
second ring was used to visualize the endotracheal tube,
which was then passed distally and further work was done with
airway control above the balloon until we were ready for the
exchange. At this time the remainder of the flap was cut
using [**Hospital1 **] scissors and hemostasis was obtained using cautery
on the tracheal mucosa. At this time, a prelubricated #8
Shiley tracheostomy was brought onto the field. The
endotracheal tube was withdrawn under direct vision to above
the tracheotomy site and the tracheostomy placed into the
trachea uneventfully. CO2 return was assured as was
ventilation. The tracheostomy was sutured in place with 0
silk and then secured with umbilical tapes. The inferior
portion of the tracheostomy wound was closed slightly with a
single #3-0 nylon. The superior stay suture was removed. The
inferior stay in the flap was left in place and secured with
a Tegaderm for access should there be an inadvertant removal.
Procedure was terminated. Estimated blood loss was less than
5 cc.

At this time, the neck wound was covered. The over drape was
removed and attention was turned to the abdomen.

A 6 to 8 cm incision was fashioned in the midline. The skin
was incised sharply. Subcutaneous tissues were divided with
the [**Last Name (un) 4161**] and traction. The linea [**Female First Name (un) **] was incised with
cautery and the calciform ligament was visualized. This was
swept to the right and the peritoneum was entered along the
left margin of the falciform. The abdominal contents were
visualized. The colon was identified clearly and swept
inferiorly. The stomach was grasped with long Babcocks in
left upper quadrant and delivered into the wound. At this
time, 2 Babcocks were placed to hold the stomach up in the
wound. Concentric 2-0 silk pursestring sutures were placed
into the anterior wall of the stomach at the junction
approximately of the antrum and the body. At this time [**Last Name (un) **]
cautery was used to enter the stomach through the
pursestrings. This wound was dilated slightly with a clamp
and a #24 Malecot catheter was passed into the stomach. At
this time, the pursestrings were tied and the catheter was
withdrawn through the abdominal wall approximately 6 cm to
the left of the midline and 2 fingerbreadths below the costal
margin. This was done by incising the skin generously and
passing a Sarot clamp, antegrade into the abdomen and
withdrawing the end of the Malecot catheter. At this time,
the Malecot was withdrawn to bring the stomach snuggly up
against the anterior abdominal wall. Just prior to
withdrawing the catheter the final 2 cm, a 3-0 silk suture
was placed into the posterior rectus sheath and the stomach
to tack the stomach up to the abdominal wall. This was tied
as the Malecot was withdrawn to have the stomach flushed with
the posterior sheath. At this time, the Malecot catheter was
secured in place on the skin with a #2-0 nylon.

The midline at this time was irrigated with copious normal
saline and closed with a running #0 PDS suture. Subcutaneous
tissues were once more irrigated and hemostasis was assured.
The skin was closed with staples. Dry sterile dressings were
applied. The gastrostomy tube was placed to gravity drainage
and will be maintained that way for 24 hours at which point
the patient can be fed. Estimated blood loss was less than 5
cc. Patient tolerated both procedures without incident.

IVC FILTER PLACEMENT

PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained
from the
[**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy, the patient was placed supine on the
angiographic table.  Right groin was prepped and draped in
standard sterile fashion.  Using sterile technique, local
anesthesia and ultrasound guidance, the right common femoral
vein was accessed and a vascular sheath for the delivery system
of IVC filter was advanced into the inferior vena cava.  The
venogram was then performed demonstrating patent inferior vena
cava, and the level of renal veins was identified to be at L1
vertebral body.  Based on radiologic findings, it was decided
that the patient would benefit from placement of an IVC filter.
The tip of the sheath was positioned in the infrarenal IVC at
the level of L1 under fluoroscopic guidance.  The filter was
then advanced into the sheath and placed into the infrarenal
portion of the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The sheath was
then removed and hemostasis was achieved after 10 minutes of
manual compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
There were no immediate complications.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of intraluminal thrombus in the right common
femoral vein,
right iliac and IVC veins.
2.  IVC filter placed into infrarenal location.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50yo man w/ rapidly progressing ALS who is
status post tracheostomy, PEG, IVC filter placement with course
complicated by peptic ulcer cauterization, and antibiotic
treatment for S. aureus and B. fragilis bacteremia.
.
#Respiratory failure:
The pt initially presented from home [**2187-8-3**] w/ chronic
complaints of weakness, difficulty eating, and intermittent
shortness of breath. At the time on the medical floor he had
worsening secretions in his oropharynx requiring nasotracheal
and oropharyngeal secretions with distress resulting in
hypertension and tachycardia. A Scopolamine patch was placed and
pt was admitted to the MICU on [**2187-8-8**] for more intensive
monitoring and nursing care. He subsequently recovered, was
extubated, and was called out to the floor on [**2187-8-10**].
.
The patient's respiratory status remained stable until late
night on [**8-21**]. The pt had a sudden onset of SOB with
diaphoresis, followed by hypotension. The MICU team was called.
The pt's vitals at midnight were T 96.1, BP 154/80, HR 100, RR
26, O2 83% on 2L NC. At this point the pt was placed on NRB.
During this period the pt's family was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding his
code status. He had been DNI only until the day prior when the
pt and his family decided to allow for intubation for scheduled
PEG placement [**8-22**]. Given this reversal of code status,
clarification was warranted. Initially the pt's wife/hcp could
not be reached. At 12:15 am the pt's vitals were BP 86/66, HR
70, RR 16. ABG was done and showed 7.04/121/138. The pt was
placed on peripheral dopamine and given an amp of HCO3. A CXR
was performed and did not show any acute pulmonary process. An
EKG was without acute changes. The pt's wife was reached and
affirmed that the pt was to be full code. The pt was intubated
at around 12:30 am for hypercarbic respiratory failure. His
dopamine was discontinued as his pressure stabilized. He was
further supported hemodynamically with IVF boluses (1.5 L) prior
to arriving to the ICU. In ICU a R IJ TLC was placed and pt was
bolused to maintain pressures.
.
In the ICU, pt was stable and multiple attempts to wean him for
extubation, but he was unable to maintain ventilatory status on
his own. After much discussion with the family in conjunction
with the palliative care team, the decision was made to place
tracheostomy and gastric tube.  After trach placement, attempts
were made to place him on trach collar which he was only able to
tolerate for short periods. He was fitted for a Passy-Muir Valve
to allow him to speak with the trach. He has some endotracheal
secretions for which he is treated with glycopyrrolate.  He is
currently vented with Vt 600 cc Respiratory rate: 14 PEEP: 5
cm/h2o FIO2: 40 % which he tolerates well.
.
#GI bleed: He was initially guaiac negative during his
hospitalization. Pt's hematocrit dropped to 17 on [**2187-9-9**]. A
abdominal CT was performed that showed no RP bleed but
high-density material in the stomach, concerning for gastric
hemorrhage.  We attempted to draw a residual through his PEG,
but it was obstructed, unable to infuse or withdraw. Hemolysis
labs were not revealing. His stools then became guaiac positive
during this time period. GI was consulted and performed an EGD
which showed an ulceration at the PEG tube site that was
cauterized. Surgery was consulted to reassess the PEG tube, and
it was cleared with sodium bicarbonate tablet solution.  He was
maintained on [**Hospital1 **] PPI. Anticoagulation was stopped and a
retrievable IVC filter was placed on [**2187-9-11**]. His Hct was
subsequently stable. He received a total of 5U PRBC for this
bleed. Throughout hospitalization PEG worked without difficulty.
.
#Tachycardia: Pt was tachycardic throughout stay. TSH wnl. Pain
and anxiety were adressed with psych consult and starting
mirtazapine in addition to his home sertraline. He denied any
pain that might be contributing. He had an echocardiogram which
showed hyperdynamic LV function. In discussion with cardiology,
we believe that his tachycardia may result from autonomic
instability resulting from his ALS. During the remainder of his
hospitalization, his heart rate was controlled with low-dose
metoprolol.
.
#Bacteremia: Pt has been afebrile. WBC stable. Follow-up
cultures are negative to date.  Completed 14-day course of
vancomycin for coag-negative S. aureus, levofloxacin and
metronidazole for B. fragilis.
.
#h/o DVT: Pt had wafarin and heparin doses adjusted depending on
his antibiotic regimen and OR status. He was maintained on low
dose wafarin while on levofloxacin and metronidazole. All
anticoagulation was stopped on [**2187-9-9**] with his GI bleed. A
retrievable IVC filter was placed on [**2187-9-11**].
.
#Elevated troponin: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a troponin leak at the time of
intubation peaking at 1.4. He had no EKG changes without a bump
in his CK, so he likely had a reversible ischemic event in the
context of sepsis, tachycardia, and intubation.  He denied any
CP at the time. His troponins trended down thereafter.
.
#ARF: During this hospitalization, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an acute
increase in his creatinine despite good UO. Renal U/S ([**2187-8-27**])
was negative for hydronephrosis. His UA showed urine
eosinophils. His creatinine increase corresponded to his
starting Zosyn, so Zosyn was stopped with slow resolution of his
creatinine to baseline.
.
#Disposition: Mr. [**Known lastname 50219**] health is stable and transferred to
Radius [**Hospital 7755**] Hospital.
