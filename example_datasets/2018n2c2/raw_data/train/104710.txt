Cystoscopy
Angiogram of the left kidney

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 59777**] is a 44 year old female with a history of recently
diagnosed stage IV non-small cell lung cancer metastatic to
brain, adrenals, and kidneys who presents with complaints of
blood when she urinates. She notes that she first noticed this
two days ago. She also notes pain with urination since she
noticed the blood. She ntes it has been the worst between 1 am
and 5 am where she can't leave the BR due to constant need to
urinate. She also urinates several times during the day.  Each
time is extremely painful. She notes that since the bleeding
began, the pain has begun to improve but the bleeding has
continued at the same frequency.  She denies any vaginal
bleeding, melena, hematochezia, or hematemesis.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, 98.3, 108/70, 96, 18, 100% RA.  While in the ED
she was noted to have frank hematuria. Pelvic exam was performed
without evidence of vaginal or cervical bleeding. No obvious GI
bleeding was noted. She was guiaic negative. Labs were
remarkable for Hct drop from 34->20 over 1 month. Coags, WBC,
and plts normal. Electrolytes showed new renal failure with
BUN/Cr 46/2.3 from 14/0.6 1 month prior. K was 6.0, bicarb 17.
U/A revealed >50 RBCs, 21-50 WBCs, LE and nitrite negative, and
no bacteria.   She received 30 grams of kayexalate, 10 mg of
dexamethasone, zofran, and morphine.  Prior to floor transfer,
she lost her IV access. Bilateral femoral CVLs were attempted
but wire could not be passed. She then had a successful R IJ CVL
placement.

Currently, she feels well.  Episode of frank hematuria witnessed
upon arrival to the floor, also notable for stringlike clot. On
ROS, she denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, DOE.  She
does note increased fatigue and recent poor po intake. She also
notes intermittent nausea when taking her medications.  She
denies any numbness or tingling, weakness, or confusion. Denies
any muscle or joint pains which the exception of chronic R thumb
pain which improved with steroids and has worsened with taper.
All other ROS negative.

Past Medical History:
# stage IV non-small cell lung cancer metastatic to brain,
adrenals, kidneys (see below)
# h/o intermittent asthma
# h/o tooth infection & extraction between [**2184-2-15**].
# History of subluxation of the metaphalangeal joint in
[**2178-6-17**].
# Prior history of obesity.

Past Oncologic history:
Initially presented in [**2-/2184**] with complaints of weight loss,
nausea and vomiting.  It seems that her symptoms were initially
mild.  She did not have shortness of breath, cough or other
complaints at that time.  By [**3-/2184**], she continued to lose
weight and was found to have a potential right-sided dental
abscess.  She was treated for that empirically with antibiotics
and continued to have weight loss, diarrhea.  It seems that in
the end of [**Month (only) 958**] and beginning of [**5-/2184**], the patient
represented to medical attention with mild shortness of
breath with exertion and chest discomfort.  She also had noted
at that point subjective low-grade temperatures and some cough
productive of brown sputum.  In [**5-/2184**], she already had a
20-pound weight loss.  During the initial presentation, she also
complained of one episode of hemoptysis with production of more
than one teaspoon of blood. Due to the above-mentioned symptoms,
the patient underwent a computer tomography of the chest on
[**2184-5-14**] that disclosed a 2.6 cm cavitary lesion in the
posterior right upper lobe with additional smaller right-sided
pulmonary nodules and extensive right hilar lymphadenopathy with
marked narrowing of the hilar airways and vessels. At that
point, further staging imaging was obtained with a computer
tomography of the torso on [**2184-5-29**] that disclosed the chest
findings as detailed above.  There was also right upper lobe
pulmonary interstitial thickening, which was worrisome for
lymphangitic spread.  There was a subtle sclerosis of the T4
vertebral body.  There was no evidence of extrathoracic disease.
 The adrenals had 2 cm masses.  There were multiple enlarged
retroperitoneal lymph nodes measuring up to 1.3 cm. An MRI of
head was performed on [**2184-5-29**] and showed multiple areas of
enhancement identifying with surrounding edema in both cerebral
hemispheres as well as in the posterior fossa.  The largest
lesion measured 1.5 cm in the left frontal lobe. The patient had
had some intermittent headaches that were thought to be
migraines at that point.  However, she had no problems with
motor strength up to the time of initial MRI when she developed
some gait instability and required a cane.  She also complained
of intermittent blurry vision.  She was diagnosed the etiology
of the brain lesions.  A brain biopsy was performed on
[**2184-5-30**].  Multiple fragments were obtained.  All showed small
nests of large cell undifferentiated carcinoma throughout brain
lesions.  D cells were positive for CK7 and TTF1. Due to the
presence of nonsmall cell lung cancer with brain metastasis and
edema, the patient was referred to neurooncology and radiation
oncology.  Whole brain radiation was started on [**2184-6-5**].  The
patient received 3000 cGy to the brain.  She was also started on
dexamethasone.  Her last day of radiation was [**2184-6-15**].  She has
most recently been on a steroid taper. She is currently in the
planning stages of palliative chemotherapy.

Social History:
Lives in [**Location 1411**] with fiance and three children. The patient
started smoking cigarettes at age 13. ~45-pack-year history.  No
history of alcohol use.  She has a remote history of prior
intravenous drug use and cocaine use.  Originally from Sicily.
Moved to USA in [**2135**]. She worked as a domestic cleaner and had
some exposure to areas affected by asbestos and heavy chemicals.
 She currently is out of work and living with family members.

Family History:
Mother, grandfather, and grandmother with DM. Father passed away
at 76 due to "natural causes". Mother is 76. [**Name2 (NI) **] maternal

Imaging:
========
CXR ([**7-10**]):
IMPRESSION: Development of focal area of increased density in
the right mid
lung consistent with atelectasis or consolidation. PA and
lateral views may
be helpful for further evaluation.

Renal US [**7-9**]:
1. Multiple bilateral hypoechoic renal masses, consistent with
known
metastases.
2. Doppler ultrasound demonstrates rapid systolic upstrokes,
with impaired
diastolic flow, and elevated resistive indices. The main renal
veins are
patent. These findings most likely reflect increased vascular
resistance
secondary to mass effect of multiple metastatic lesions. There
is no evidence for renal vein thrombosis.

CXR [**7-8**]:
Tip of the new right internal jugular line projects over the low
SVC.
Mediastinal widening and right hilar enlargement due to
adenopathy are stable. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Lungs are grossly clear. Heart size normal.

ECG [**7-7**]: NSR @ 83.  Nl axis and intervals. Isolated < 1 mm STE
in aVF. Compared to prior [**2184-5-30**], no sig change.

renal u/s [**7-7**]: Both kidneys enlarged and heterogeneous. Both
contain multiple masses with indistinct borders, some appear
hypervascular. No hydronephrosis. Echogenic lesion in bladder
likely representing blood clot.

Pelvic US [**7-7**]:

CT torso [**6-30**]:
1. Slight decrease in the size of right upper lobe lung nodules.
There has been no substantial change in the appearance of the
hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
2. Slight increase in the size of the bilateral adrenal lesions.

3. Increase in confluence and increase in size of some of the
bilateral renal lesions. Retroperitoneal and mesenteric
lymphadenopathy as before.

[**6-30**] bone scan:
No evidence of osseous metastatic disease. Abnormal uptake in
the
kidneys bilaterally. Recommend correlation with additional
anatomic imaging, such as ultrasound, as clinically indicated.


Brief Hospital Course:
44F with metastatic NSCLC (brain, bilat adrenals, bilat kidneys)
p/w frank hematuria, anemia, renal failure. The bleeding was
from renal mets and was localized to the L kidney based on blood
seen coming from the L ureter at cystoscopy. The renal failure
was believed to be due to a combination of ATN, mets, and
contrast. Ultimately she was started on HD. The L kidney was
embolized to prevent further bleeding. She is now HD dependent.
Her hospitalization has been further complicated by pneumonia
and adrenal insufficiency.

Ultimately, after a trial of dialysis, the pt opted to be CMO.
However, when she did not pass over a weekend, she considered
this a sign that she could live longer and possbily survive
cancer. A family meeting was convened and an accommodation was
achieved wherein we would restart abx and try to relieve her of
her anasarca using either diuretics or ultrafiltration. That
said, after failing diuretics and prolonged difficulties with
the dialysis catheter, another meeting was convened. Antibiotics
were stopped again and the patient was returned to [**Location 3225**] with
ultrafiltration. During an ultrafiltration treatment, she went
into respiratory failure and passed.
