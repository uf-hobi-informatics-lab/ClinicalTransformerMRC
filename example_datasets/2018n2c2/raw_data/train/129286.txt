cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
87-year-old M with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia presented to OSH [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with SSCP. Patient woke up in the morning and went for
walk/gardening then started to feel very badly around 10 am,
nauseas, profuse sweating and feeling as though his chest was
going to "explode". He went home and tried to vomit but couldn't
so presented to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]. At baseline he is very active
and can do 30 minutes on the stationary bike or 20 minutes of
rowing. He has never had similar symptoms in the past.
.
At OSH, VS 97.2 63 135/78 20 97% RA. EKG showing STE in inferior
leads. Treated with heparin bolus of 4200 units no gtt,
Integrillin bolus 6.8 ml with no drip, 2 sublinqual gtt then
stopped, and 2 mg of Morphine IV and 2L NS. Attempted to give
Lopressor IV but after 1 mg pt's b/p dropped to 96/48 so not
given. Patient transferred for cath.
.
Cath here showed a proximal RCA occlusion with placement of 3
BMS. Transferred to ICU for hemodynamic instability, started on
Integrilin gtt and Dopamine gtt for hypotension although AO
137/75 during cath. Upon arrival to the ICU patient is totally
CP free. He c/o feeling cold and thirsty/dry mouth. ROS negative
for h/o stroke, GI/GU complaints.

.
[**6-24**]: Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent flow limiting stenosis. The LAD had mild diffuse
disease. The
LCX had no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenosis. The
RCA was
a dominant vessel and was totally occluded proximally.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
pressure.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal systemic pressure.
3. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
 3 bare metal stents placed in the RCA vessel.
.
[**6-26**]: ECHO: EF 45-50%.  The left atrium is normal in size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed with inferior
akinesis/hypokinesis and inferolateral hypokinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. At least moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, AS REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN
MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS:
Pt is an 87 yo M with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia who presents with
IMI s/p 3x BMS to proximal RCA lesion.
.
#) CAD: IMI with proximal RCA occlusion, CK here 217 Trop 0.04
- trend CK to peak
- monitor on tele
- start ASA desensitization protocol given allergy
- Plavix
- high dose statin
- Integrilin x 18 hrs
- wean dopamine given elevated SBP, low dose beta blocker once
off dopamine
- echo in AM to evaluate EF
- daily EKG
- bolus IVF for hypotension
- start ACEI once hemodynamically stable
- going check, PM Hct, plts
.
#) Hypotension. Transient, likely in setting of vasodilators at
OSH. Started on dopamine --wean as SBP tolerates.
- bolus IVF for hypotension
- low dose beta blocker
.
#) Rhythm: NSR, RBBB, ? old
- contact PCP for old EKG
- monitor on tele for PR prolongation, LAFB
- low dose beta blocker
.
#) Pump: echo in AM
.
#) Hyperlipidemia: high dose statin
.
#) HTN: holding hctz, low dose beta blocker as tolerated
.
#) FEN: bolus IVF prn, cardiac diet, replete lytes prn
.
#) PPX: PPI, bowel reg prn
.
#) Access: PIV x 2
.
#) Dispo: ICU level of care pending hemodynamic stability
.
#) Code: full

Discharge Instructions:
You came in after experiencing a heart attack.  You underwent
cardiac catheterization and had three stents placed in your
right coronary artery.  You tolerated the procedure well.  We
performed an aspirin desentizitation protocol to start aspirin.
.
Please take all of your medications as instucted.  We made the
following adjustments:
1.  Plavix: you MUST take this medication every day for the next
month.  We recommend you take it for at least 1 year or
otherwise as pe your cardiologist
2.  Toprol XL once daily
3.  Atorvastatin 80mg daily (stop you simvastatin)
4.  Stop your hydrochlorothiazide.
5.  Aspirin 325mg daily
6.  Lisinopril 5mg daily
.
Please contact your PCP or come to the [**Name (NI) **] if you experience
chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain.  Please
followup with your PCP within the next 1-2 weeks.

Followup Instructions:
You have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**7-11**] at 11:00AM.
Please call his office @ [**Telephone/Fax (1) 30419**] if any changes need to be
made.
.
