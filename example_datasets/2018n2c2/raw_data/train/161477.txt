Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Aspirin / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Quinine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain, Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year old man with schizophrenia, HTN, and G6PD
deficiency presenting with 2-3 days of increasing intermittent
abdominal pain. Reportedly was having diarrhea at Group Home,
though pt states he has not had bowel movement in 4 days, no
hematochezia. He states that abdominal pain comes on suddenly,
[**9-16**] and sharp in quality, when he drinks fluids, lasts for a
few seconds and self-resolves. Has not been able to eat in the
last 2-3 days due to decreased appetite. No fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Lives at group home.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.8 73 114/69 16 95% on ?RA. Vitals
stable at triage but became increasingly unresponsive,
responding to painful stimuli. Pupils 2mm, minimally reactive.
Patient was given 0.4 narcan, and appeared to transiently be a
little more alert, though he appeared to sometimes respond to
sternal rub even without narcan for 30-60 seconds. He received a
total of 2mg narcan in the ED. FAST ultrasound showed small
ascites, pericardial effusion, but no signs of tamponade. CT
abdomen showed moderate ascites, pericardial effusion, diffuse
bowel wall edema. Guaiac negative. EKG similar to prior. Also
received potassium repletion in ED for K of 2.8. Serum tox
negative. Vitals on floor prior to transfer are as follows: T 98
HR 64 BP 139/80 RR 16 O2sat 100%2L NC.
.
On the floor, patient is alert and oriented, responsive to
questioning. He feels hungry and would like to try eating food.
He denies current abdominal pain.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI. He has lost 30 lbs unintentionally in the last [**4-10**]
months due to decreased appetite. He does report that he is
urinating frequently because he is drinking lots of fluid.
Denies dysuria or nocturia.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of
breath. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
.

Social History:
Patient originally from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 466**] [**Country 467**], [**Country 480**]. Moved here 30 yrs
ago. Currently lives in Group Home. Works as cab driver for
30yrs. Educated through 8 years of elementary and middle school
in [**Country 480**]. Did one year of training in electronics here but
could not find a job, so continued as a cab driver. He is not
married, has no kids. Has 2 brothers and 2 sisters in [**Name (NI) 480**],
not well in touch with his family back home.
States that he is given meds at Group Home three days/week
(Wed/Thurs/Fri), and he takes meds himself the other four days
of the week.
Tobacco: Smoked x 30yrs, quit 2wks ago
Marijuana: Smoked x 20yrs, states he quit 10yrs ago b/c too
expensive. (per OMR, he has smoked marijuana prior to ED visits
in [**2173**])
ETOH: reportedly none
Illicits: no IV drug use or cocaine use


Family History:
No known family history of kidney, liver, cardiac disorders, but
patient not well in touch with family.

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 97.8 BP: 140/82 P: 72 R: 21 O2: 92%RA
General: Alert, oriented x3, no acute distress, decreased
attention-- unable to list months of year backwards (able to
state [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 359**])
HEENT: Sclera mildly icteric, mildly dry mucus membranes,
oropharynx clear; lower lip appears large (but pt states this is
his normal)
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated
Lungs: Does not give good inspiratory effort, but soft rhonchi
at bilateral bases
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, early systolic
murmur [**3-15**] loudest at LUSB
Abdomen: moderately distended, non-tender, hypoactive bowel
sounds, no rebound tenderness or guarding
Ext: warm, well perfused, trace pulses, 1+ peripheral leg edema



Pertinent Results:
CXR - [**2178-6-9**]
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes, with bronchovascular crowding and
possible superimposed mild edema. No focal consolidation noted.

.
CT -abdomen [**2178-6-9**]
1. Diffuse small bowel wall edema. No pneumatosis. DDx includes
reactive due to ascites/hypoproteinemia; mesenteric ischemia,
although no atherosclerotic disease; angioedema due to ACE-I
2. Normal size of AAA
3. Cardiomegaly with large pericardial effusion
4. Moderate-large ascites, new from [**2178-10-3**].
5. Nodular patchy opacities at lung bases, right > left, in
bronchovascular distribution suggest aspiration
6. Vicarious excretion of contrast via gallbladder and oral
contrast in the large bowel suggest recent prior imaging, not at
our institution.
.
CT HEAD [**2178-6-9**]
1. No acute intracranial process
2. Hypoattenuation in the bilateral periventricular white matter
may be sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemic disease but
has progressed from [**2173**] and is greater than expected in this
age group.
.
EKG: [**2178-6-9**]
NSR, rate 69, LVH, borderline LAD, inverted T waves in V-V4,
biphasic T waves in V5. (changed from prior)
.
TTE [**2178-6-10**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2167-1-7**], the degree of LVH is now moderate.
There is now a very small pericardial effusion (without
tamponade).
.
CXR [**2178-6-11**]: Severe cardiomegaly is stable. There are low lung
volumes. Pulmonary edema is mild-to-moderate, has worsened.
Bilateral pleural effusions are small and new or newly apparent.

.
RUQ US [**2178-6-11**]: IMPRESSION: Initial four quadrant ultrasound did
not demonstrate enough free fluid for paracentesis. This
suggests that prior ascites may have shifted. Note is also made
of sludge in the gallbladder with nonobstructive non-shadowing
small stones. Previously visualized focal lesion at the liver
dome is not visualized as no focal hepatic lesions are
identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
30 yo male with HTN, hypokalemia, CKDIII, h/o untreated positive
PPD presents with few days abdominal pain that has now resolved
with 2-3 months weight loss, bilateral leg edema, anorexia found
to have anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure,
hypoalbuminemia, symmetric diffuse lymphadenopathy and volume
overload with exam suggestive of acute diastolic heart failure.
Concerned for neoplastic and, chronic inflammatory, or
infectious processes.
.
# Acute diastolic heart failure: He was noted to be in acute
diastolic heart failure on transfer from the ICU. He was given
lasix 40 mg iv x 1, and continued on a 20 mg iv daily regimen,
then was transitioned to 40mg PO daily. Daily weights and I/O's
were followed. His blood pressure was controlled as below; in
particular, he was started on beta blocker, resumed on an ACEI
(which he apparently did not fill at his pharmacy), and started
on spironolactone as well. His O2 requirement was weaned off.
.
# Hypoalbuminemia: possibly renal or primary GI. Nothing on
history to suggest primary GI protein losing enteropathy though
this should be considered (i.e. celiac sprue, lymphoma, IBD,
amyloid etc.) especially in light of improving renal function
which argues against primary renal protein loss, low albumin,
absence of known liver disease and weight loss. SPEP/UPEP
negative. Anti-TTG IgA negative. Pt should discuss need for
colonoscopy with his PCP given anemia, weight loss and age.
.
# Gram positive bacteremia, unclear source: He was initially
started on vanc, but this was d/c'd when this culture latered
speciated with coagulase negative staph. No subsequent cultures
had growth.
.
#non-specific enteritis-seen on CT scan. This likely explains
reports of abdominal pain and diarrhea recently. Pt's abdominal
pain resolved. He did not have diarrhea and stool studies were
negative. Symptoms resolved and pt was tolerating a regular
diet.
.
# Weight Loss - 25-30lb. Large DDx. Concerning for primary
neoplastic vs. GI-infectious vs. GI/systemic infectious. See
above. Nothing on history/exam to suggest primary rheumatologic
disorder, ESR 13, [**Doctor First Name **] negative. He was scheduled for a lymph
node biopsy (his R inguinal lymph node seemed the largest),
excisional by surgery. However, he refused this. Contact[**Name (NI) **] legal
guardian [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as well as PCP regarding this issue. Pt
initially stated he did not have enlarged lymph nodes. However,
later on he stated that he knew the reason to biopsy the lymph
nodes was to look for "cancer" and then stated that he would
never have a biospy. Discussed this with patient's PCP and legal
guardian who did not want to force (by physical or chemical
restraint) the patient to undergo a procedure against his will.
Discussed possibility of biopsy with the patient multiple times
and he did decline, but agrees to follow up with his PCP for
further evaluation.
.
# Acute Renal Failure w/ proteinuria: Lack of schistocytes on
initial smear argued against TTP etiology. Likely pre-renal,
perhaps due to poor po intake. unclear if he was hypotensive in
the ED. FENa suggested prerenal etiology. Creatinine improved to
baseline. He should have chemistries/electrolytes followed after
discharge. Creatinine on discharge 1.6.
.
# Altered mental status, from opiates received in the ED now
resolved. He was initially admitted to the ICU given his
unresponsiveness after opiates. This resolved after being given
narcan and never reoccurred.
.
# Anemia - His B12, folate, and iron were normal. Smear was
checked in ICU and only rare schistocytes were seen. HIV Ab was
negative. His hematocrit was stable on monitoring and was 30.1
on day of discharge without evidence of bleeding. This is likely
due CKD. However, given recent abdominal pain and anemia pt
should undergo a colonoscopy.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - He was found to have thrombocytopenia,
thought to be subacute, given that he had 130K one month ago.
His platelets were monitored and normalized. Splenomegaly not
noted on imaging. HIV negative. Could have been due to
medications or acute illness.
.
# Ascites - new finding. Had not been tapped b/c ICU felt not
tappable. No known chronic liver disease or cirrhosis.
Considered lymphoma, occult cirrhosis, TB peritonitis on
differential given +PPD, abdominal pain, weight loss. TB
enteritis normal affects IC valve area which he does not
radiographically/clinically have. RUQ US was without significant
ascites, not enough to tap; no cirrhosis noted. This could be
due to heart failure, but is likely due to low albumin.
Quantiferon gold PENDING at time of discharge.
.
# Hypertension - He was continued on his home regimen, although
it was found that he wasn't filling these prescriptions as an
outpt. Given proteinuria, he was (re-)started on an ACE-I. He
was also started on spironolactone given his heart failure and
hypertension (after drawing renin and aldosterone). He was
started on beta blocker given dCHF.
- With chronic hypokalemia, sent renin / aldosterone levels
since these have never been sent, to rule out
hyperaldonsteronism. These are still PENDING at time of
discharge.
.
# Hypokalemia- see above, concern for hyperaldo. Repleted dialy.
Pt started on spironolactone and still required supplementation
of potassium. Suggested to decrease home potassium regimen by
[**2-8**] given CKD and use of spironolactone. Pt should have his
potassium checked regularly.
.
# Lymphadenopathy - bilateral inguinal and axillary. He denied
fevers and chills, but noted weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, ahnd
elevated LDH,  suggested biopsy to r/o TB, lymphoma (with flow
cytommetry), etc.  Surgery prepared for excisional biopsy of LN,
but pt refused. Pt refused on multiple occasions. See above. PCP
and legal guardian did not want to for pt to undergo procedures
and testing that he did not want. Pt was aware that biopsy was
suggested to r/o cancer.
.
# Positive PPD (untreated) - CXR was performed without note of
tuberculous disease INH is contraindicated in G6PD deficiency.
.
# Pericardial Effusion - likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia.
Mild per ECHO (not large as reported on CT), no signs of
tamponade. Other DDx = TB (though usually much larger), other
Rheum disorders (unlikely by hx/exam). This was likely due to
hypoalbumenemia.
.
# Long QT: Present also on EKG [**2178-5-8**]. His potassium was
repleted. QTC remained ~440 with haldol dosing. Serial EKG were
performed. Pt's haldol dose was decreased to 5mg from 10mg due
to this. EKG's should be monitored in outpatient setting.
.
# Lacunar infarct, clincally quiescent: Seen on head CT, and new

since [**2173**]. Would recommend outpatient workup for PFO, etc.
.
# Psych: schizophrenia, formerly pleasant did become
inexplicably agitated about prospect of getting LN biopsy. Pt
found to lack capacity by psychiatry and found to have a legal
guardian-[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]. Pt's guardian was updated on pt's
clinical course and as above did not want to pursue restraints
(physical/chemical) in order to enforce biopsy. Pt was taken off
his depakote during admission given altered mental status and
this should be resumed upon discharge. Pt's haldol was decreased
to 5mg from 10mg given above. Pt remained pleasant throughout
the remainder of the hospitalization.
