[**2108-7-19**] CT NECK: IMPRESSION:
1. Exophytic polypoid, hyperenhancing mucosal mass lesion in the
posterior hypopharynx protruding into the airway lumen at the
level of the piriform sinuses without obstruction.  This, in
combination with enlarged left level II and level V lymph nodes,
one of which is necrotic, is concerning for malignancy. Direct
visualization is recommended.
2. Nonenhancing, cystic-appearing lesion is noted on the right
retropharyngeal and right masticator space, causing mild mass
effect in the right carotid space, correlation with MRI of the
neck with and without contrast is recommended for further
characterication.
3.  Hyperdense secretions in the left maxillary sinus may
represent fungal or inspissated secretions, incompletely
evaluated on this study.
4.  Patulous upper esophagus.
.
[**2108-8-3**] PET/CT: IMPRESSION:
1. FDG-avid hypopharyngeal mass and cervical lymphadenopathy.
2. FDG-avid right 7th rib sclerotic focus, concerning for
metastasis.
3. Airway narrowing. This finding was discussed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11925**]
with the clinical team at the time of completion of the study.
4. Tree in [**Male First Name (un) 239**] and ground glass opacities in the right middle
lobe, which are non-specific but concerning for aspiration in
the setting of pharyngeal obstruction.
5. Ascending aortic dilation.
6. Calcified splenic artery aneurysm.
7. Tiny lung nodules. Follow up is recommended within one year.
.
[**2108-8-8**] RIGHT RIB X-RAY: IMPRESSION:
1.  Large amount of free air underneath the hemidiaphragms.
Subcutaneous air. This should be correlated with the recent
surgery and if it cannot be explained by the surgery, further
evaluation with CT can be performed to assess for perforation.
2.  Sclerotic right seventh lateral rib lesion concerning for
metastasis is best evaluated on the PET-CT examination.
.
[**2108-8-9**] MRI BRAIN: IMPRESSION:
1.  Unchanged bilateral retropharyngeal and masticator space
lesions, with cystic/necrotic changes on the right side,
previously demonstrated by neck CT on [**2108-7-19**], likely
related with a history of hypopharyngeal cancer.
2.  Intracranially there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement
to suggest metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.
3.  Chronic lacunar ischemic changes are demonstrated in the
cerebellar hemispheres. Subcortical and periventricular areas of
chronic small vessel disease. No acute or subacute ischemic
changes are identified.
.
[**2108-8-9**] VIDEO SWALLOW: IMPRESSION: Aspiration of thin and nectar
thick liquids after the swallow in patient with hypopharyngeal
mass.
.
[**2108-8-20**] CXR: CONCLUSION: There is a pneumonia at the left lung
base.

.
[**2108-8-26**] CXR: COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from [**8-20**] and [**8-21**], [**2108**]. There is gradual progression of multifocal
consolidations, currently extensively involving left lower lobe,
left upper lobe and right lower lobe.  In addition, there is
interval development of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
.
[**2108-8-28**] CT HEAD: IMPRESSION:
1.  No definite acute intracranial process.
2.  No major vascular territorial infarct.  If clinical
suspicion is high, MRI could be considered.
3.  Left basal ganglia lacunes, age-related involution and mild
small vessel ischemic disease.
4.  Re-demonstration of cystic mass in the right retropharynx.
5.  Longstanding left maxillary sinus disease with atelectatic
appearance of the sinus and bony sclerosis.
.
[**2108-8-28**] MRI/MRA BRAIN: IMPRESSION:
1.  Multiple small acute infarcts in bilateral cerebral
hemispheres, right pons, and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres,
suggesting a central embolic source.  This was discussed with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from neurology between 4:30 and 4:45 pm on [**2108-8-28**].
2.  No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease.
3.  Partially visualized bilateral retropharyngeal and right
masticator space masses, related to the patient's known
hypopharyngeal cancer.
4.  Unremarkable head MRA.
.
[**2108-8-29**] ECHO: IMPRESSION: LIMITED VIEWS. Suboptimal image
quality. Preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Cannot assess right ventricular function, aortic valve
structure/function, or tricuspid valve structure/function.
.
[**2108-9-2**] CXR: IMPRESSION: There are bilateral layering pleural
effusions and residual patchy airspace opacity in the left upper
lobe, left middle lung and at both bases.  These findings may
reflect pneumonia.  There is likely a superimposed component of
mild interstitial edema as well.  Right Port-A-Cath is unchanged
in position.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Overall, cardiac and
mediastinal contours are likely stable, although the left heart
border is somewhat obscured by the overlying effusion.
.
[**2108-9-3**] ECHO: No thrombus/mass.  Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2108-8-29**], a PFO is now detected.
.
[**2108-9-3**] LE DOPPLER U/S: IMPRESSION:
1. Non-occlusive deep venous thrombosis within a short segment
of the right peroneal vein.
2. No deep venous thrombosis within the left lower extremity.
.
[**2108-9-10**] CXR: IMPRESSION:  No change from 9:54 a.m. in
pneumomediastinum and bibasilar opacities.
.
[**2108-9-15**] RUE DOPPLER U/S: IMPRESSION:  No right upper extremity
deep venous thrombosis.
.
[**2108-9-20**] CTA NECK IMPRESSION:
1.  Status post tracheostomy placement with tip terminating
within the intrathoracic proximal trachea.  Thickening of the
pretracheal soft tissues at the level of the tracheostomy entry
likely post-surgical in nature. No evidence of erosions into
adjacent vessels by the tumor or active bleeding. interval
decreased size of level 5 abnormal lymph node and right
parapharyngeal cystic mass.
2.  Hypopharyngeal mass as described, smaller since the prior
examination.
3.  Blurring of the fat planes of the anterior neck as it could
be seen with radiation.
4.  Enlarged lymph nodes in the AP window and pretracheal
spaces.
5.  Worsening pleural effusions and parenchymal opacities that
could be seen with volume overload. .
.
[**2108-9-27**] pCXR FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is an unchanged right basilar opacity.  The extent and
severity of the parenchymal opacity is similar to the previous
examination.  Tracheostomy and right-sided Port-A-Cath are
unchanged.  Unchanged mild retrocardiac atelectasis.  No
pneumothorax.
.
[**2108-9-25**] CXR FINDINGS:Analysis is performed in direct comparison
with the next preceding similar study of [**2108-9-10**].  The
tracheal cannula is in midline position, seen to terminate in
the trachea.  Termination point is similar as it was before.
The on previous examination identified paratracheal air and
subcutaneous air in the left lower neck region, indicative of
pneumomediastinum at that time, cannot be seen anymore.  No
pneumothoraces present.  Heart size unchanged.  The previously
existing pulmonary congestive pattern and bilateral basal
parenchymal infiltrates have regressed markedly.  No new
abnormalities are seen.  A remaining diffuse haze on the left
base is indicative for some pleural effusion layering
posteriorly. IMPRESSION:  Stable position of tracheostomy
cannula, previously identified pneumomediastinum has
disappeared.  No pneumothorax.
.
[**2108-10-2**] pCXR: FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is no relevant change.  Tracheostomy tube in constant
position, right pectoral Port-A-Cath.  Constant elevation of the
right hemidiaphragm with minimal blunting of the costophrenic
sinuses.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No newly
appeared parenchymal opacities.  No pulmonary edema.
.
[**2108-10-12**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Tracheostomy tube is in standard
position.  Right subclavian infusion port ends in the mid to low
SVC.  No mediastinal widening or pneumothorax.  Lungs are
essentially clear.  Small right pleural effusion unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
72yo man with h/o EtOH abuse, DM, recently diagnosed
hypopharyngeal SCC admitted [**2108-8-7**] to ENT service for biopsy of
pharyngeal mass, G-tube and port placement.  Then transferred to
the oncology service on [**8-8**] for initiation of chemotherapy.  His
hospital course was significant for initiation of tube feeds
after failing a swallow evaluation.  Chemotherapy with
docetaxel, cisplatin, 5FU was initiated [**2108-8-11**], complicated by
diarrhea, severe cytopenias, ? leaking G tube, severe
nausea/vomiting.  On [**2108-8-19**], he received 10mg olanzapine for
nausea and subsequently became very lethargic and developed
fever, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and ultimately
transfered to the ICU [**2108-8-20**] for sepsis and neutropenic fever.
His ICU course was significant for diagnosis of LLL pneumonia,
hypotension attributed to hypovolemia [**3-8**] limited PO
intake/diarrhea vs. sepsis, improvement in acute renal failure,
hypernatremia.  He has had frequent atrial ectopy and PVCs and
electrolyte abnormalities.  ENT planned for tracheostomy [**2108-8-28**]
for airway protection during therapy, but on [**2108-8-28**] early AM,
he was found to have left facial droop.  MRI confirmed CVA
suggestive of thromboembolism.  TTE showed no evidence of clot.
Neuro recommended starting heparin ggt, which was started
[**2108-8-29**].  TEE could not be done given size/location of
hypopharyngeal mass.  Repeat TTE with bubble study revealed a
PFO and LE doppler U/S showed a RLE DVT.  The tracheostomy was
eventually placed [**2108-9-10**].  However, this was complicated by
bleeding over one week.  Anticoagulation was stopped as a
result.  A rechallenge with anticoagulation failed a second time
due to bleeding from his tumor and trach site.  He has
subsequently been managed with venodynes and prophylactic
heparin 5,000 units SC TID.  On [**2108-9-24**] he coughed out his
tracheostomy cannula.  Replacement was complicated by bleeding
and hemoptysis requiring ENT evaluation.  Bleeding/hemoptysis
resolved gradually over next 4 days.  He again developed
aspiration pneumonia [**2108-9-28**] and was started on cefepime and
vancomycin.  His respiratory status was stable and actually
improved rather quickly.  Antibiotics were stopped [**2108-10-3**].
Combination XRT and cetuximab was planned.  A loading dose
(400mg/m2) of cetuximab was given [**2108-10-3**] and radiation started
[**2108-10-10**] and will continue for 6 weeks total.
.
MICU COURSE:
Mr. O' [**Known lastname **] was admitted to MICU For airway monitoring after
trach placement.  Trach placement was uncomplicated.  On
admission, he was breathing comfortably and in no distress.
Post-op CXR was performed, which showed pneumomediastinum; this
was not unexpected given recent open procedure.  Repeat CXR
showed no change in pneumomediastinum.  Post-op trach care was
administered including airway suctioning as needed.  Tube feeds
were re-initiated with additional boluses of free water given
hypernatremia.  Enoxaparin was held overnight on day 1 of MICU
course because of bleeding from suction.  However, bleeding was
limited, so enoxaparin was restarted in the morning of MICU day
2.  Ophthalmology was consulted for continuing care of VZV; they
recommended continuing acyclovir.  He remained hemodynamically
stable and returned to the primary team.
.
OTHER DETAILS:
# Cough: CXR negative.  Cough may be due to XRT.  Continued
suction and humidified air via trach.
.
# Recurrent aspiration pneumonia/sepsis: Resolved.  Episode
[**2108-8-20**] required transfer to ICU with relative hypotension,
tachycardia, fever, hypoxia, and tachypnea.  LLL pneumonia on
CXR treated initially with vancomycin, cefepime, and
metronidazole due to concern for aspiration.  CXR [**2108-8-21**] and
[**2108-8-26**] showed worsening infiltrate, so abx changed to meropenem
with vancomycin [**2108-8-26**], finished [**2108-9-3**]. Concern for another
episode of PNA prompted use of vanco and cefepime [**2108-9-28**] -
[**2108-10-3**].  Continued to have secretions and rhonchi.  Guaifenesin
PRN cough.  Aspiration precautions.  AVOID sedating meds.
.
# Eye pain: Due to post-herpetic neuralgia +/- stye.
Ophthalmology consulted.  Started on lubrigel to maintain
hydration to eye surface.  Tramadol and acetaminophen PRN.
.
# Left eye lens implant (for ?glaucoma): Outpatient
bacitracin/polymyxin B used initially; stopped per
Ophthalmology.
.
# Zoster: VZV culture positive.  Started on acyclovir treatment
dose x10d, then changed to prophylaxis dose.  Ophthalmology
consulted; no ocular involvement initially, then filamentary
keratopathy seen [**2108-10-4**].  Pain initially controlled with
gabapentin, titrated off [**2108-9-15**] to avoid somnolence.  Restarted
gabapentin given increased pain; will titrate up dose.
Acetaminophen and tramadol PRN.
.
# S/P trach [**2108-9-10**]: Complicated by bleeding, resolved off
anticoagulation, now on heparin SC.  Cuff deflated [**2108-9-14**].
Routine trach change to uncuffed trach [**2108-9-17**].  CTA [**2108-9-20**]
showed soft-tissue swelling around the trach, but no active
bleed.  Coughed out trach tube [**2108-9-24**], re-bled then, now
resolved.  Airway suctioning PRN.  Continued telemetry for
continuous O2 monitoring (hospital policy for trach patients).
.
# Hemoptysis: As above.  ENT consulted.  No bleeding from tumor,
likely source is mild trauma from trach replacement.  Resolved.
- Change trach tube as needed or recommended by ENT/resp care
team.
.
# Hypopharyngeal squamous cell CA: T1N2bMx stage [**Doctor First Name **].  Started
cycle #1 TCF chemo [**2108-8-11**] complicated by N/V, severe cytopenias,
sepsis, and CVA.  Per ENT, the mass initially was filling the
hypopharynx and likely affecting his ability to handle
secretions though the airway was open.  Trach postponed due to
acute CVA, initially planned for [**2108-8-28**].  Per ENT (via
laryngoscopy), excellent response to chemotherapy with a ~90%
reduction in tumor size.  Unable to continue with TCF given
life-threatening complications, his treatment was changed to XRT
with concurrent cetuximab as a radio-sensitizer.  Loading dose
cetuximab 400mg/m2 given [**2108-10-3**].  2nd weekly dose delayed due
to insurance issues; given 250mg/m2 [**2108-10-12**].  Anti-emetics PRN.
Caphasol, Maalox/diphenhydramine/lidocaine PRN mouth pain.
Continue daily XRT with weekly cetuximab for six weeks total.
.
# CVA/PFO: Left face drooping seen [**2108-8-28**]; MRI positive for
CVA, likely embolic.  Neurology consulted and heparin gtt
started.  Aspirin started [**2108-8-28**], but stopped when heparin
started.  MRA brain unremarkable.  TTE negative for clot.  No
TEE given location of tumor.  Repeat TTE with bubble study
showed a PFO.  LE doppler U/S showed a RLE DVT, possible  source
of CVA and [**Last Name (un) **] (paradoxical emboli).  Heparin gtt changed to
enoxaparin.  Then stopped for post-trach bleeding complications.
 Restarted heparin gtt [**2108-9-19**] and stopped [**2108-9-20**] due to
recurrent trach bleed.  Continue heparin 5000U SC TID.  PT/OT.
.
# RLE DVT: Anticoagulation stopped due to trach bleeding.  IVC
filter considered, but decided against.  Continued heparin SC
PPx and venodynes.
.

infusions with furosemide/metolazone effectively diuresed.
.
# NIDDM: HbA1c 7.0 on [**2108-8-9**].  Endocrine following.  Insulin
glargine dose at 6U daily.  Cover with insulin sliding scale.
.
# Hypertension: Decreased amlodipine 10 to 5mg daily [**2108-8-30**] and
discontinued [**2108-9-13**] to change to metoprolol given ectopy.
Metoprolol dose increased from 12.5 to 25mg [**Hospital1 **].  Added back
amlodipine 5mg daily [**2108-9-20**].  Trigger for hypertensive urgency
[**2108-9-21**], so amlodipine increased to 10mg daily.  Started
lisinopril 5 mg daily [**2108-9-30**] for SBPs in 160s for several days.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for a biopsy of a tumor in
your throat (hypopharynx).  A G-tube for tube feeding and a port
for chemotherapy were placed.  The tumor biopsy confirmed
squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) and you were transferred to the
Oncology floor to start chemotherapy.  MRI of the brain did not
show any cancer in the brain.  Video swallow evaluation showed
severe aspiration of food and liquids.  You cannot eat or drink
until this is re-evaluated.  All of your nutrition must come
through tube feeds.  Tube feeds were started and you developed
high blood sugars managed with insulin.
.
Chemotherapy was difficult to tolerate.  You needed several
different types of anti-nausea medications.  All of your blood
counts became very low from the chemotherapy.  You developed
fevers and pneumonia that were treated in the Intensive Care
Unit with IV antibiotics.  You also developed a stroke with
left-sided weakness.  The stroke likely originated from a blood
clot in the right leg that traveled in the blood stream and
passed through a hole in the heart (patent foramen ovale) and
then into the brain and kidney also causing some kidney damage.
You were started on a blood thinner for this.  To prevent
difficulty breathing from future radiation therapy, a
tracheostomy was placed.  However, this was complicated by
bleeding and the blood thinner was not able to be restarted.
You also developed a rash on your left forehead.  Culture
confirmed this was shingles.  You were treated with an
anti-viral drug acyclovir and a pain medicine gabapentin for it.
.
You developed recurrent pneumonia and were started on IV
antibiotics.  You coughed out your trach tube, but this was
replaced.  You started daily radiation treatment [**10-10**],
Monday through Friday for 6 weeks.  You will also be treated
with weekly cetuximab immunotherapy during your radiation.  Your
first dose was on [**2108-10-3**].  As radiation therapy continues, your
cough may worsen and require more suctioning.

TRANSITION ISSUES:
1. You will return to [**Hospital1 18**] for daily radiation therapy, Monday
to Friday, for 6 weeks.
2. You will receive weekly cetuximab infusion therapy weekly
until radiation therapy is completed.
3. You will be going to a rehab center for physical therapy.

Followup Instructions:
YOU WILL NEED TO FOLLOW-UP WITH YOUR ONCOLOGIST DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
