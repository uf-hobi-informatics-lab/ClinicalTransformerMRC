History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 553**] [**Known lastname 1806**] is a 56 year-old woman with a history of bipolar
disorder, hypothyroidism, psoriatic arthitis, and diabetes
mellitus who presents with mental status changes since [**8-2**].
According to her family she was in her usual state of health
until about a week ago when she started having difficulty with
word finding, short term memory, using household items, and was
walking slowly.  They also state that she seemed slightly
unsteady while walking but has had no other abnormal movements.
Of note, she was prescribed TMP/SMX on [**7-30**] for nasal cellulitis.
 Her son, a nurse, suspected lithium toxicity and called her PCP
who referred them to the ED.

In the ED, her initial vitals were T 98.8, HR 63, BP 144/64, RR
20,  100% RA.  She was found to have a Cr of 1.3 from a baseline
of 0.7 and a lithium level of 2.0.  Glucose was 215 (she has had
episodes of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic episodes in the past).
Toxicology was consulted, recommending dialysis due to her
symptoms.  Nephrology recommended aggressive hydration first,
and regardless, the patient refused to have dialysis or Foley
catheters placed.  She received 3 L NS in the ED with marked
improvements in her symptoms, although she did not return to
baseline.  She was admitted to the MICU for monitoring and
aggressive diuresis.

Upon arrival, her vitals were T 36.4, HR 66, BP 154/69, RR 19,
Sat 99% RA.  She was comfortable and in NAD.

ROS:  Positive for loose stools for several months, and
increased urinary frequency for one day.  She had no fevers,
chills, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, urinary
frequency, or extremity pain.


Past Medical History:
Diabetes type II on insulin
Psoriatic Arthritis
Thyroid cancer s/p resection and radioactive iodine
Hypothyroidism
Bipolar disorder

Social History:
SH: She used tobacco in her early 20s, no alcohol, no other
drugs.  Lives at home with husband.


Family History:
Strokes in mother and father.  Renal disease and MI in brother.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 553**] [**Known lastname 1806**] is a 56 year-old woman with a history of
insulin-dependent DMII, bipolar disorder, and psoriatic
arthritis who presents with altered mental status, acute kidney
injury, and elevated lithium levels.

# Altered mental status: Altered mental status most likely cause
by lithium toxicity in the setting of acute kidney injury. No
evidence of infection on UA, no fever or leukocytosis. She has a
history of AMS with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states, but her
hyperglycemia was relatively mild and her serum osmolarity was
normal.  Toxicology initially recommended dialysis, but
nephrology recommended trying aggressive diuresis before
dialyzing the patient, who said that she would refuse a dialysis
catheter. Lithium was held, [**Known lastname **] was held and she was
hydrated agressively with LR, since patient has received 6 L NS
and developed a hyperchloremic acidosis. Lithium levels were
checked Q6hours and she was discharged when Lithium levels
returned to [**Location 213**]

# Acute kidney injury: Her creatinine was elevated to 1.3 from a
baseline of 0.7 on admission.  This was thought to be most
likely intrinsic from TMP/SMX usage, but there she may have had
prerenal physiology as well due to decreased PO intake.  There
was no evidence of obstruction or infection. [**Location **] and
[**Location **] were held, she was hydrated and electrolytes were
followed.

# Diabetes mellitus: Chronic issue which was stable during
admission. She was kept on her sliding scale insulin, metformin
was held. She refused to take her long acting insulin

# Psoriatic arthritis: Symptoms were stable.  She can continue
taking her Methotrexate and Enbrel as an outpatient

# Hypothyroidism: Chronic, stable. Continued home levothyroxine.

# Bipolar and anxiety disorders: Chronic, stable.  She has no
mood symptoms and her altered mental status is not at all
consistent with mania or depression.  We continued her home
benzodiazepines and held lithium in the setting of acute
toxicity.

# Anemia: Initial hematocrit was normal, but that may be in the
setting of hemoconcentration.  No evidence of acute bleeding.
Stool Guiac was negative and serial crits were stable.

Transitional Issues:
- She was told to hold her [**Location **]. Restarting should be
decided by outpatient physician
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] may have increased her Lithium level in setting of
[**Last Name (un) **]. [**Last Name (un) **] should not be used for her in the future. Again,
she was instructed to follow up with her outpatient PCP
regarding [**Last Name (un) **] use.
- She needs to be encouraged to keep her outpatient
appointments.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 1806**],

It was a pleasure treating you during your hospitalization. You
were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with Lithium toxicity and Acute Kidney
Injury. It is believed that because of your nasal cellulitis you
became dehydrated which affected your kidneys ability to clear
Lithium. The [**Hospital1 **] antibiotic you took for cellulitis may have
also caused some kidney injury which may have increased your
Lithium level as well. Dehydration, kidney injury and increasing
Lithium levels in your blood caused your altered mental status,
difficulty finding words and unsteady walking. You were treated
with aggressive hydration and stopping Lithium. You were
observed and as your Lithium levels fell to normal range you
became more alert and mentally clear. You are being discharged
in stable condition with a normal Lithium level.

The following changes to your medications were made:
- You can begin taking your Lithium again tomorrow [**8-6**] at your
regular home dose
- You should avoid taking [**Month/Year (2) **] again in the future because it
may have increased Lithium levels on your body
- Please do not take your [**Month/Year (2) 21177**] until you see your
outpatient physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] can elevate Lithium levels.
- No other changes to your medications were made, please
continue taking your home medications as prescribed
- It is very important that you see your primary doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]e. You have been scheduled appointments with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 14973**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 67006**].
