Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo F with PMH schizoaffective disorder, CAD, HTN, DM,
restrictive lung disease, discoid lupus, and h/o CVA, who p/w 3d
h/o audio and visual hallucinations, leg pain, and SOB with
altered mental status.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

#Alered Mental Status/Hallucinations: Given pt's history of
schizoaffective disorder and vascular dementia, initial
presentation was thought to be related to delirium vs.
progressive dementia or primary psychiatric condition. Initial
work-up for infectious and neurologic causes of delirium were
unrevealing. Urine analysis was unremarkable, chest xray showed
no infiltrate, blood cultures showed no growth. A head CT was
negative for an acute intracranial process. A head MRI was also
obtained to further evaluate for neurologic causes,and showed
only chronic changes and no new areas of ischemia.  An EEG was
obtained and was negative for epileptiform activity.  Over the
course of the work up described above, the pt slowly became more
withdrawn, which was different from her initial presentation in
which she was talkative and quite labile with religious ideosity
and frequent outburts of "hallelujah" and "praise [**Doctor Last Name **]."  She
began to answer fewer questions, and began to appear somewhat
paranoid.  Psychiatry saw pt and recommended increasing
antipsychotic dosage from short acting seroquel 250mg po qhs, to
long-acting seroquel 300mg po qHS and adding on haldol 1mg po
BID.  This was done, and the next morning ([**2165-8-16**]) the patient
seemed withdrawn and stuporous.  She was awake but not
responsive to questions verbally, answering only with mild head
nodding. At this time, she was found to have a urinary tract
infection (see below), seroquel and haldol were discontinued and
the urinary tract infection was treated and her mental status
improved the following day, returning to a level similar to at
the time of admission.

On [**2165-8-20**], she appeared ill and was again withdrawn.  She was
febrile and diaphoretic.  Antibiotic coverage was broadened to
vanc/cefepime/flagyl.  Pt then developed recurrent SVT to the
220s, relieved with carotid massage.  She appeared rigid and
diaphoretic.  She was transferred to the ICU for further
management.  In the unit psychiatry was consulted and atypical
presentation for neuroleptic malignant syndrome was considered.
She was treated with 2mg cogentin and ativan with mild
improvement in her mental status.  She was transferred back to
the general medicine floor, where her mental status continued to
wax and wane but never returned to her initial level of
interactiveness on admission.  She was responsive to some
questions, but refusing to answer others.  She did not
participate in physical exam commands.  She remained stable at
this point for several days.  Given the extensive negative work
up for delirium, this was considered to be her new baseline and
placement was found for skilled nursing facility for discharge
with permission from her health care proxy.  At time of
discharge, the patient remains AAO x2 (unchanged from before);
she is alert and talkative; still having delusions that her
family is outside waiting for her; gets agitated about wanting
to leave hospital and often refuses to sit or stay in bed.
Throughout hospitalization the patient was convinced that her
hallucinations and delusions were real.
.
# Urinary tract infection: [**2165-8-18**] patient was febrile and urine
analysis suggested urinary tract infection. She was treated with
ceftriaxone. Urine culture revealed
grew out presumptive Strep Bovis and E.coli grow out in her
urine.
.
# Supraventricular Tachycardia: Patient has a remote hx SVT, on
metoprolol for rate control. On [**2165-8-19**] she developed SVT to the
220s, which resolved spontaneously. Over the course of the
following day, she had 4 more episodes of SVT which responded to
carotid massage, she was never hypotensive. SHe was transferred
to the MICU for closer monitoring. Cardiology was consulted who
identified the rhythm as atrial tachycardia vs. AVNRT.  The
patient has been stable on Metoprolol 200 mg [**Hospital1 **].

# Hypoxia: On admission, patient was hypoxic with 2LNC O2
requirement. There was no evidence of pulmomary edema or
consolidation. She was quickly weaned to room air. As part of a
work up, an ABG was performed which showed pO2 of 58, this
corrected to 92 with 2LNC. Patient was maintained on
supplemental oxygen without improvement in mental status. Given
significant a-A gradient, and persistent tachycardia, CTA was
performed and showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Patient
has a 20 pack year history and likely has baseline hypoxia with
sufficient compensation to maintain peripheral O2 saturation
>92%.  At time of discharge, the patient no longer has an oxygen
requirement, and is satting mid to high 90s on RA.

# Ankle pain: Initial laboratory analysis was remarkable for CK
in the 800s and an elevated ESR and CRP. Given her complaints of
left leg and ankle pain, orthopedic and rheumatologic causes
were considered, as well as PE.  Plain films of the left ankle
and hip were negative for fracture, but did show an area of
possible bone infarct in the distal tibia of unclear
significance.  Rheumatology was consulted who did not believe
the presentation was consistent with SLE, or gout. Amyloidosis
was also considered however SPEP and UPEP, total protein and
globulin levels were unremarkable. Statin-induced myopathy was
considered, and statin was held however CK had already begun to
trend down when the statin was stopped, making statin induced
myopathy unlikely.   A LE doppler was negative for DVT. MRI of
the leg MRI was done to evaluate for myositis, skeletal
vasculitis or other inflammatory myopathy, and diabetic
myonecrosis. It was negative for any muscle inflammation or
necrosis, and showed only edema in the subcutaneous tissues,
which had been noted on physical exam. Within the first few days
of her admission, ankle pain and erythemia resolved, etiology
remains unclear.
.
#Cog-wheel rigidity/masked facies/resting tremor - On admission
to the MICU, the patient developed acute presentation of
symptoms concerning for extrapyrimidal symptoms related to
antipsychotics.  Patient had received PRN doses of haldol, home
seroquel 250 mg.  However, all antipsychotics had been D/C'd 2
days prior to symptom onset.  Antipsychotics were held.  The
patient was given 1 mg cogentin x 2.  Psych was consulted, who
felt that her symptoms were consistent with EPS.  The patient
was started on Ativan 1mg q6 hrs PRN agitation.  Upon transfer
back to the general medicine floor, her rigidity had improved
and she continued to be treated with prn ativan for agitation,
though this made pt quite somnolent.  On [**2165-8-25**] she was
restarted on seroquel 50mg po BID prn agitation in an effort to
avoid sedation associated with benzos.  Then as per Psych
recommendation, the patient was restarted on low dose, 25 mg,
seroquel [**Hospital1 **].  All other PRN doses of seroquel and Ativan were
held.  The patient seems to be responding well to this regimen.
.
# Hypertension - pt had very difficult BP management while in
house.  She was still measuring in SBP 170s on several occasions
despite being on max dose of numerous BP meds, including
metoprolol, losartan, furosemide, and clonidine patch.  While in
house, hydralazine 10mg po TID was added to pt's regimen, and
metoprolol was further increased to 200mg po BID for management
of SVT.  On this regimen, her pressures ranged from SBP 140s -
150s, occassionally in the 170s.

# hypercholesterol:  Because of elevated CKs (peaked at 819),
the patient's Simvastatin was discontinued.  CK normalized to 92
by time of discharge.  She should have her CK rechecked as
outpatient and consider restarting simvastatin as outpatient.

INACTIVE ISSUES:

# CAD - Chronic.  Clopidogrel was continued on admission but
simvastatin was discontinued shortly after admission secondary
to elevated CK levels.

# restrictive lung disease: Chronic.  Patient was continued on
albuterol, ipratropium, tiotropium. Symbicort was replaced with
advair during admission due to formulary.  Pt is likely
compensated at a lower pO2 secondary to her lung disease.  She
was repeatedly hypoxic during admission without complaints of
shortness of breath.  Of note, pulse oximetry measured O2 sats
in mid-90s on several occasions in which ABG drawn at same time
showed hypoxia, so pulse ox is not reliable measure  of oxygen
status in this patient.

# DM - held glyburide, gave SSI while in house

# h/o candidal rash: miconazole powder

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# schizoaffective disorder: The patient was admitted on Seroquel
250 qhs and because of the possibility of NMS, the patient is
being discharged on Seroquel 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Her lorazepam was held
throughout hospital admission.

# please check the patient's CK as an outpatient, as she had
elevated CK levels as outpatient.
