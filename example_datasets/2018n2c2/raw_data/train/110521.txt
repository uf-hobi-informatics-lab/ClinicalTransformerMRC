No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Hematemasis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy

History of Present Illness:
80F with past medical of history of gastric ulcer, right
peroneal DVT in [**2111**] on indefinite anti-coagulation with
warfarin which has been held since [**2112-6-14**] in setting of
multiple admission to OSH for melanotic stools, PVD s/p multiple
lower extremity revascularization, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
presenting with one day history of vomiting blood x 1 and
melanotic stool x 5 who presents as a transfer from the MICU to
[**Hospital1 139**] B wards.

Briefly, she presented 2 days ago with hematemsis and melana x1
day and was sent in by her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the ED, she was transfused 2U
pRBC (Hct 23 on admission, baseline 33).  She was admitted to
the ICU. Post transfusion Hct 29, then down to 27, another 1U
pRBC, then Hct 30. EGD showed gastric ulcers with likely recent
bleed, but no intervention was undertaken except for biopsies
which are still spending. GI service was consulted and
recommended [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI. She was Briefly electively intubated for
EGD for concerns of airway protection, then extubated without
complication. She has not been hypotensive since admision, and
atually was hypertensive to SBP200s due to discontinuing home BP
meds, and got IV labetalol. She has now been restarted on home
oral PO meds. Her stay in the ICU was unfortunately complicated
by a fever to 101.6- repeat CXR after extubation showed a
possible LLL infiltrate vs. effusion vs. atelectasis which was
suspicious for VAP and she was started on cefepime Vancomycin
today on [**10-14**]. Of note, she was scheduled for lower extremity
PVD revascularization, and the GI and vascular surgery services
have been coordinating her outpatient antiplatelet regimen in
the setting of this GI bleed
Pt is feeling well today and says she does not feel light
headed, dizzy, or fatigued. She reports no abdominal pain right
now. (States her presenting symptom other than hematemesis and
melena was only fatigue, no pain).
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, unintentional weight loss (25 lb over last year),
fatigue
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
80F with past medical of history of gastric ulcer, right
peroneal DVT in [**2111**] on indefinite anti-coagulation with
warfarin which has been held since [**2112-6-14**] in setting of
multiple admission to OSH for melanotic stools, PVD s/p multiple
lower extremity revascularization, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
presenting with upper GIB confirmed on EGD during this admission


# Upper GI bleed, gastric ulcers
Patient presented reporting signs and symptoms of upper GIB with
melanotic stool and hematemsis and was supported by significant
BUN/Cr dissociation. The patient underwent EGD which showed
multiple ulcers in the stomach with evidence of recent bleed.
She was transfused 3 U pRBCs during the admission- two in the ED
and one in the MICU, and put on IV PPI and sucralfate.  Patient
was hemodynamically stable throughout with and hematocrits held
around 30.

#VAP/Hypoxia
She developed a fever in the MICU,  and given that it was 24 hrs
after intubtation with question of an infiltrate on CXR, she was
started on cefepime and vancomycin which she received for 24
hrs.  These meds were d/ced on the floor as repeat CXR did not
show good evidence of pneumonia and she did not look clinically
infected. She was treated empirically with Vancomycin 75 mg q 12
and Cefepime 1 g q 12 hr.  A repeat CXR PA and Lateral was
obtained which was not impressive for an infiltrate- the patient
remained asymptomatic and afebrile so the abx were discontinued
at 24 hrs.  However, on exam the patient was noted to have
crackles about halfway up on both lung fields.  She was given a
one time IV dose of lasix and restarted on her home regimen.
Her oxygen requirements were optimized by the time of discharge
and she was on her home lasix regimen.

#Drug-induced Pancytopenia
Patient has had thrombocytopenia on past labs of uncertain
etiology.  She was noted to have downtrending WBCs to 1.6 by [**10-15**]
and was technically still anemic.  A smear noted some occasional
schistocytes but hemolysis labs were negative.  Hematology was
consulted and thought the vancomycin or cefepime was causing
marrow toxicity.  She was monitored for the next few days until
her counts began to increase.  They went up to WBC 2.6 21%
neutrophils (ANC still below 1000).  Per heme recs she was given
1 dose of neupogen.  Her CBC then increased to WBC 7.1 with
almost 70% neutrophils.  She was discharged with close follow up
with her hematologist.Her CBC was closely monitored during her
hospital stay.

# Hypertension
The patient's home blood pressure medications were held when
admitted to the ICU for concern of GIB.  She actually became
hypertensive during this time.  Upon arrival to the floor her
home BP meds were restarted as below.  She remained stable,
although with an episode of overnight hypertension 2 days prior
to discharge.
- diovan 320 mg PO qD
- labetalol 100 mg PO TID
- nidefipine ER 60 mg PO qD

#PVD: Patient was originally scheduled to have a revision of a
previous vascular surgery during the time frame of her
admission.  This was obviously postponed, but the issue of her
anticoagulation remained.  She had a prior DVT which she takes
warfarin for but this has been held since [**Month (only) 116**] due to recurrent
GI bleeds.  The vascular surgery team expressed they would like
her anticoagulated for her PVD.  After consulting with both GI
and Vascular it was decided that she could go out on plavix, and
hold aspirin given her risk of rethrombosis in her vascular
stents combined with the stability of the bleed.


# Acute renal insufficiency
Patient has baseline Cr ~ 0.7 with admission Cr 1, which came
down to 0.9- no issues since admission

CHRONIC ISSUES

# Chronic back pain
- continued tramadol prn

# Hyperlipidemia
- continued statin, ezetimibe

# History of DVT
- We held warfarin as above

Transitional Issues
-She will follow up with hematology in 3 days for repeat cbc.
-Patient has blood cultures and urine cultures that need follow
up
-She should also be optimized on home BP meds for better
hypertension control

Discharge Instructions:
Mrs [**Known lastname 68391**],

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for
melanotic stools and hematemesis and were found to have an upper
gastrointestinal bleed.  You were given 2 units of blood in the
emergency department and then transferred to the ICU and given 1
unit of blood.  The gastroenterologists took you down for an
endoscopy which showed a recently bleeding ulcer- they took
biopsies of it which showed inflammation- there was no other
intervention performed.  You were briefly given antibiotics for
pneumonia but were taken off after 24 hrs treatment.  Your WBCs
were noted to be abnormally low and a hematology consult was
obtained.  It was thought that either the vancomycin or cefepime
caused your low blood counts.  We watched them for a few days
and they struggled to increase.  You received one dose of
neupogen, which helps stimulate the bone marrow, and were
cleared for discharge as your WBC increased to 7.1 with almost
60% neutrophils.

The following changes have been made to your medications:

It was a pleasure taking care of you while at [**Hospital1 18**]
