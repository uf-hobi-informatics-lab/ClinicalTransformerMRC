Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
headache, nauesa/vomiting, vertigo

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cerebellar lesion resection x2
EVD
VPS placement

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 63-year-old RH woman with a history of non-small
cell
lung CA (stage IIIa, s/p chemo, XRT, and L upper lobectomy), PE
35 yrs ago, rheumatic fever in childhood, prior tobacco use who
presents with headache, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, and blurry
vision for the last 2 weeks. She reports a holocephalic
headache,
extending from the back of her head up to the front bilaterally
starting about 2 weeks ago. The headache is constant, not
throbbing, and worsens with any movement particularly when she
stands up. It does not seem to worsen with lying down and has
not
woken her from sleep. She says she used to get migraines but has
not had one in years; thinks this headahce feels somewhat
similar
but is atypical in its duration. In addition she has has
worsening nausea with vomiting, and for the last two days has
not
been able to keep anything down. She has also noticed that her
vision appears "cloudy" over the last week and a half. Upon
further questioning she says she thinks it appears double
sometimes but is unsure if the images are vertically or
horizontally displaced. She has not tried covering one eye to
see
if it improves. She is not sure if it is worse when looking
toward one direction or the other. Currently her vision seems a
little blurry but denies diplopia at the moment.

Within the last two days she has also begun to experience
dizziness, which she describes as the room spinning. She has
also
had difficulty walking and says she feels very unsteady on her
feet. Unsure if she is falling toward one side or the other. She
came into the ED today because she was continuing to feel worse
and was unable to keep down anything by mouth.

On neuro ROS, the pt reports headache, blurred/double vision,
vertigo, difficulty walking as above. Denies difficulty
speaking,
loss of vision, focal weakness, numbness/tingling,  bowel or
bladder incontinence or retention.

On general review of systems, the pt reports frequent chills but
does not think she has had any fevers. Denies recent weight loss
or gain. Denies cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain
or
tightness, palpitations. +Nausea/vomiting, no abdominal pain.
has
not had a bowel movement over the last few days which she
attributes to not eating. No dysuria. Denies rash.

Past Medical History:
Lung cancer, stage IIIa (T1b, N2, M0)
- [**4-1**] persistent nonproductive cough, chest x-ray at that time,
which demonstrated a hilar mass

CT head noncontrast [**2-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Two new posterior cranial fossa/cerebellar lesions, with
surrounding edema and mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle,
concerning for metastatic disease.
2. A new 1.1 cm mass lesion in the third ventricle, with mild
hydrocephalus, concerning for additional site of metastatic
disease. An MRI with contrast is recommended for further
evaluation.

CT head with contrast [**2-22**]:
1. Right cerebellar and third ventricle lesions are new from
[**2166-8-18**],
concerning for metastatic disease. If clinically feasible, MRI
is more
sensitive to detect small lesions and leptomeningeal disease.
2. The lateral ventricles are slightly enlarged compared to
[**2166-8-18**],
raising the possibility of mild hydrocephalus due to third
ventricle lesion.

MRI with and without contrast [**2-23**]:
Supra- and infra-tentorial as well as intraventricular
metastatic
disease, notably involving the left insular cortex, right
cerebellar
hemisphere, and third ventricle.
While the right cerebellar lesion is associated with significant
mass effect and distortion of the fourth ventricle, there is
currently no CSF obstruction or hydrocephalus. The third
ventricle lesion is located below the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] and
likewise does not cause hydrocephalus.

MRI C/T spine [**2-24**]
1. Compression fracture, with mild loss of height of the
Thoracic T5
vertebral body with marrow edema pattern. No retropulsion of the
fragments,
no canal or compression on the cord. While this has the
appearance of a
benign compression fracture, given the history, an associated
pathologic
lesion within the T5 body cannot be completely excluded.
Correlation with
radionuclide studies and CT is recommended. No enhancing lesions
in the cord.

2. Multilevel mild degenerative changes in the cervical spine
without
significant canal or foraminal stenosis.

3. A 3.3 x 3.5 cm nodular lesion in the lower neck/upper
mediastinum, new
since the prior CT chest of [**2166-11-27**]. This needs further
evaluation with CT chest, including the lower neck. There is
moderate amount of pleural
effusion/pleural thickening noted on the left side.

MRI [**Doctor Last Name **] [**2-26**] FINDINGS: Since the prior study, the patient has
undergone biopsy of the
right cerebellar hemispheric lesion. Expected postoperative
change are seen
with relatively extensive intralesional hemorrhage and a
circumscribed tissue
defect. The previously reported extensive vasogenic edema as
well as mass
effect on the fourth ventricle is largely unchanged.

The previously reported additional metastatic lesions within the
left insular cortex and third ventricle demonstrate no short
interval change. However, with less motion artefact and better
image quality further lesions measuringapproximately 3 mm are
identified in the posterior aspect of the left temporal [**Month/Day (4) 3630**] as
well as the left cerebellar hemisphere.

There is no evidence of acute infarction. Flow voids of the
major
intracranial vessels are preserved.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post biopsy of right cerebellar mass with expteced
intralesional
hemorrhage.

2. No short-term interval change with regard to the left insular
cortex and third ventricle metastatic lesions.

3. Identification of additional small lesions within the left
posterior
temporal cortex as well as the left posterior medial cerebellar
hemisphere.

[**2-27**] CT FINDINGS: Patient is status post a right-sided
ventriculostomy catheter with tip terminating in the frontal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right ventricle. No associated intraparencymal or
intraventricular hemorrhage identified. Ventricles demonstrate
stable mild dilatation, unchanged from the prior CT.

The patient is status post a right suboccipital craniotomy with
partial
resection of a known right cerebellar mass. Again there is a
small amount of air and expected post-surgical hematoma at the
site of the recent surgical intervention in the posterior
cranial fossa with an increasingly hypodense appearance
consistent with evolution of blood products. A 2.8 x 2.3 cm
rounded hyperdense mass most suggestive of residual tumor,
better identified on the prior MRI, and is located just superior
to the resection site and unchanged. Known left insular cortical
mass is not well seen, and better evaluated on the MRI.
Surrounding vasogenic edema in the cerebellar
hemispheres persists but with minimally improved mass effect on
the patent
fourth ventricle. The known 1.1 x 1.0 cm hyperdense mass in the
third
ventricle is unchanged. No new parenchymal hematoma or infarct
present. The mastoid air cells, middle ear cavities and
visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post partial resection of the right cerebellar mass
with a stable distribution of surrounding vasogenic edema though
with a slight decreased mass effect on the widely patent fourth
ventricle. Continued evolution of blood products within
post-surgical hematoma. Residual tumor as described above.
2. Interval placement of a right-sided ventriculostomy catheter
with tip in the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. No intraparenchymal or
intraventricular hemorrhage identified. Stable mild dilatation
of bilateral lateral ventricles.

[**2-27**] CT ABD
FINDINGS: There is a new left paratracheal mass measuring 3.8 x
3.4 x 2.2 cm causing mild deviaiton of the trachea and left
carotid artery concerning for a lymphadenopathy due to
metastasis. There is no , axillary, mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy evident. The central vessels are unremarkable.
Heart size is normal and without pericardial effusion. A small-
to moderate-sized hiatal hernia is evident. There is a small
left pleural effusion with thickened rind evident at the level
of the upper [**Month/Day (4) 3630**], indicating chronicity.  Pleural blebs are
identified within the right lung apex. No significant
emphysematous changes are identified. Changes consistent with
left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection are
evident. Nonspecific ground-glass opacities with minimal
associated architectural distortion identified in the left lung
apex are increased compared to prior study and likely represent
post-radiation changes. Minimal dependent atelectasis in
dependent portions of both lungs.

The liver is homogenous in attenuation without discrete masses
or lesions.  There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen are normal. The bilateral
adrenal glands have normal limb thickness and are without convex
margin to suggest mass. The bilateral kidneys are normal in size
and excrete contrast symmetrically. The stomach, small and large
bowel are unremarkable. There is no retroperitoneal, mesenteric
or portacaval lymphadenopathy identified. Multiple small foci of
air are noted within the abdomen as well as a layering posterior
to the left rectus sheath muscle, likely due to recent insertion
of a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal shunt with tip ending
lateral to the liver. No free fluid identified within the
abdomen. The rectum, bladder, uterus and adnexa are
unremarkable. No pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy
identified.  The aorta is of normal caliber throughout. The main
portal vein and its major tributaries are unremarkable.

No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions evident.

IMPRESSION:
1. New 3.8 cm left paratracheal mass concerning for metastasis.
2. Expected post-surgical changes in the left upper [**Month/Day (4) 3630**]
consistent with
lobectomy and mediastinal biopsy. Increased ground-glass
opacities with
associated architectural distortion evident within the left
upper [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be related to radiation changes, though
malignancy is not excluded.
3. Small left pleural effusion, likely chronic.
4. Interval placement of a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal
shunt with tip at the level of the liver and few intraperitoneal
gas bubbles.
5. Small hiatal hernia.

[**2-27**] CT CHEST
FINDINGS: There is a new left paratracheal mass measuring 3.8 x
3.4 x 2.2 cm causing mild deviaiton of the trachea and left
carotid artery concerning for a lymphadenopathy due to
metastasis. There is no , axillary, mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy evident. The central vessels are unremarkable.
Heart size is normal and without pericardial effusion. A small-
to moderate-sized hiatal hernia is evident. There is a small
left pleural effusion with thickened rind evident at the level

The liver is homogenous in attenuation without discrete masses
or lesions.  There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen are normal. The bilateral
adrenal glands have normal limb thickness and are without convex

and its major tributaries are unremarkable.

No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions evident.

IMPRESSION:
1. New 3.8 cm left paratracheal mass concerning for metastasis.
2. Expected post-surgical changes in the left upper [**Month/Day (4) 3630**]
consistent with
lobectomy and mediastinal biopsy. Increased ground-glass
opacities with
associated architectural distortion evident within the left
upper [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be related to radiation changes, though
malignancy is not excluded.
3. Small left pleural effusion, likely chronic.
4. Interval placement of a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal
shunt with tip at the level of the liver and few intraperitoneal

[**2167-3-2**] CTA/V head
IMPRESSION: The venous sinuses are patent without filling
defect. The
non-contrast head CT findings are unchanged compared to [**2167-2-27**].

[**2167-3-6**] MRI:
1. Post operative changes in the right posterior fossa.
Peripheral enhancement
along the resection cavity which likely represents post
operative change or residual tumor.
2. Stable metastatic lesions within the left insular cortex,
third ventricle, left temporal and left cerebellar hemisphere.
3. No acute infarct.
4. Right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter with tip in
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle.



Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented to the ED on [**2167-2-21**] following 2 weeks of
headaches, nausea/vomiting, and vertigo. CT head demonstrated a
large mass in the R cerebellum and a smaller lesion in the third
ventricle. Neurosurgery was consulted in the ED and declined
acute intervention. She was started on Decadron 4mg Q6 and
admitted to the neuro-ICU for monitoring. She did well overnight
without any evidence of hydrocephalus or increasing ICP, and her
symptoms began to improve. She was transferred to the neurology
floor on [**2167-2-22**].

MRI with and without contrast was performed which demonstrated
three lesions, largest in R cerebellar hemisphere as well as two
additional masses in third ventricle and left insula.
Neuro-oncology was consulted and recommended resection of
cerebellar lesion and whole brain radiation.
Her primary oncologists Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 11309**] were also
contact[**Name (NI) **].
Neurosurgery recommended suboccipital craniectomy followed by
VPS placement.

On [**2167-2-24**]: she had increased nausea and headaches. She was taken
to the OR and underwent resection of her cerebellar mass. She
tolerated the procedure well. Post operatively she returned to
the ICU for SBP control and neurochecks. Her exam remained
stable and post operative head CT showed no hemorrhage. On [**2-25**]
she was transferred to the floor. On [**2-26**] she had a routine head
CT for preoperative planning and this showed no change from
previous scans. She was kept NPO after midnight for VPS
placement on [**2-27**].

On [**2167-2-27**]: she was taken to the operating room for VP shunt
placement. She tolerated the procedure well. Post-operatively
she returned to the floor.

Postop MRI demonstrated residual cerebellar tumor and so on [**3-4**]
she returned to the OR for craniotomy for excision of residual
tumor.

On [**3-5**], patient was doing well, having some hallunications, but
knows that they are hallunications. Her decadron was tappered
and she was transferred to the floor. Her exam remains stable;
SQH was started as well.

CV:
She was maintained on telemetry monitoring throughout her
admission.

ENDO:
She was maintained on finger sticks QID and insulin sliding
scale while being treated with steroids.

FEN:
She was maintained on IVF upon admission due to poor PO intake.
She was advanced to a regular diet as her nausea improved. She
was maintained on a bowel regimen as well as a PPI for
prophylaxis.

ID:
She developed no signs of infection during her admission.

Prophylaxis:
She was maintained on SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis and a PPI
for GI prophylaxis.
