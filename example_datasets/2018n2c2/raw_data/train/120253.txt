Attending:[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 812**]
Chief Complaint:
epistaxis/hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy x 2
Pulmonary angiography x 2

History of Present Illness:
48 yo male with a distant smoking history on Plavix for stents
presenting with hemoptysis for two days. The patient stated that
he first had symptoms two nights prior to admission when he woke
from his sleep coughing blood. He went back to sleep without
trouble. He had another episode of hemoptysis (walnut sized) in
the shower. He went to his doctor that afternoon and noted that
he had a blood clot sitting on his soft palate. The bleeding
became worse on the night prior to admission. At that time, he
was continuously coughing blood and drove himself to the
emergency room.
.
In the emergency room, the patient presented with vitals of T:
98.8, HR: 107, BP: 159/84, RR: 16, O2 sat: 94%. An NG lavage
revealed no blood in the stomach. There was concern for
intrathoracic process such as a pulmonary embolism, though D
dimer was normal. He had a chest CT which showed ground glass
opacities. He was admitted to the floor for further evaluation
of his hemoptysis.
.
The patient said that he has had blood-tinged sputum in the past
related to the change of weather and dry air, but never to this
extent.
.
No chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness,
nausea, diarrhea.
.
+recent weight loss due to gastric banding procedure

Radiology Report	CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY	Study
Date of [**2174-9-22**] 4:36 AM

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Multifocal areas of ground-glass opacities, particularly in
the right
lung, which are nonspecific, but likely reflect a multifocal
pneumonia.
3. Bronchial wall thickening with occlusion of several airway
segments to the
right upper and middle lobes, particularly in the right middle
lobe, likely
from mucus or with history of hemoptysis, blood.

Radiology Report	[**Numeric Identifier 70295**] SEL CATH 1ST ORDER	Study Date of [**2174-9-22**]
1:28 PM

IMPRESSION:
1. Normal thoracic aortogram.
2. Aortogram of a solitary intercostal bronchial trunk on the
right side
demonstrating no evidence for extravasation or abnormal blush.
Of note, this
vessel did have supply to the mediastinum and other midline
structures. No
intervention performed.
3. Normal right bronchial arteriogram demonstrating supply to
the right lower
lobe.

Radiology Report	[**Numeric Identifier 96893**] 3ED ORDER [**Last Name (un) **]/BRACHIOCEPHALIC	Study Date
of [**2174-9-23**] 2:17 AM

IMPRESSION: Selective right internal mammary, right subclavian
and two right
bronchial arteriograms were obtained. No evidence of
extravasation, blush, or
aneurysms could be noticed. All bronchial arteries and branches
presented
with very small caliber. No embolization was attempted via the
right
bronchial intercostal trunk due to supply of midline arteries,
likely directed
towards the spine.

[**9-26**]  Bronchoscopy

IMPRESSION:  Hemoptysis which was related on a previous
procedure to the posterior segment of the right upper lobe,
status post 2 angiograms by interventional radiology with no
embolization performed and status post repeat flexible
bronchoscopy today with a large blood clot in the right upper
lobe bronchus.

PLAN:  We will continue to monitor the patient for the time
being while off Plavix and continue to follow along with
thoracic surgery for the possible need of right upper lobe
lobectomy if the bleeding recurs.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Hemoptysis:
The patient presented with hemoptysis and had an episode of
epistaxis while in the ER. A CT of the chest revealed
non-specific multi-focal ground glass opacities, particularly in
the right lung, and bronchial wall thickening with occlusion of
several airway segments to the right upper and middle lobes.
The patient was observed in the ICU because of the large volume
hemoptysis.  He underwent a bronchoscopy by interventional
pulmonology, but they were unable to visualize the source of the
bleeding because of the large amount of blood in the right upper
lobe. He underwent IR angiography, but they were not able to
visualize the vessel because it was not actively bleeding. The
patient was transferred to the general medical floor
post-procedure where he continued to have small volume
hemoptysis.  Interventional radiology repeated the angiography
but was unable to embolize an artery because there was no active
bleed.  The patient underwent a second bronchoscopy on [**2174-9-26**],
where a clot was found to be nearly occluding the right upper
lobe; the clot was not removed for concern of re-activating the
original bleed.  [**Doctor First Name **], ANCAs, anti-GBM AB, HIV Ab, and PPD were
negative.  His plavix was held since admission, and his
hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s after an initial drop
from Hct 42 in the ED.  The patient did not require any blood
transfusions.  He did get one unit of platelets transfused, per
surgical recommendations, to provide him with more functional
platelets in the setting of recent Plavix use.

The patient was seen and evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of Thoracic
Surgery who felt that the risk of Right upper lobectomy was
higher than the risk of significant re-bleeding at this time. No
tumors or cavitary lesions were noted on the CT scan from
admission.  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient in two weeks after re-imaging by CT.

.
#Coronary artery disease:
The patient is s/p 3 vessel CABG in [**2170**] and 2 drug eluting
stents placed in [**2169**].  His plavix was discontinued because his
stents were placed about four years ago.  Upon discharge, he was
started on Aspirin 81mg every other day, per recommendation of
his outpatient cardiologist.  The patient was continued on his
home dose of simvastatin.
.
#Hypertension:
His blood pressure medication was held in the inpatient setting
in order to more effectively monitor his hemodynamic status.
His home dose of valsartan was restarted upon discharge from the
hospital.
.
#Emphysematous changes in lungs:
Emphysematous changes were noted in the patient's lungs on Chest
CT. The patient does have a 20-30 pack-year smoking history,
though he quit smoking one month ago.  He did have Pulmonary
Function Testing done prior to discharge to make sure he could
tolerate a lobectomy.
.
.
.
The patient was continued on him home medications for thyroid
hormone replacement and psoriasis.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you were coughing
blood.  Because of the large volume of blood you initially
coughed up, you were monitored in the Intensive Care Unit then
transferred to the general medical floor when stable. As you
know, you were found to have a a blood clot in the right upper
lobe of your lung, which was likely the site of your bleeding.
Duirng your hospitalization, you had two bronchoscopies to
visualize the lung and two procedures by Intervential Radiology
to attempt to find the source of your bleeding.

Emphysema changes were seen as well in your lungs on CT from
your history of smoking. You also had Pulmonary Function Testing
(PFTs) done to test your lung function in case you may need
surgery on your lungs.  Please follow up with your Primary Care
Physician regarding the pulmonary function tests and the
emphysematous changes in your lungs.

As discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], you will be discharged from the
hospital in stable condition.  The risks of surgical removal of
your right upper lung lobe were thought to be greater than the
risk of significant re-bleeding at this time.  You will follow
up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks for re-imaging of your chest.

The following changes were made to your medications:
- Please STOP taking Plavix.  You no longer need to take it for
your coronary stents.
- Please DECREASE the dose and frequency of your aspirin to a
baby aspirin 81mg [**Name2 (NI) **] Other Day.

Please seek medical attention if you cough up more blood, have
lightheadedness or dizziness, or develop any symptoms that are
concerning to you.
