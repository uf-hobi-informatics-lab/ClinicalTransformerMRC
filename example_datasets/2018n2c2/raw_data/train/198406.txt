Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] y.o. female with past medical history of CAD,
critical AS, hypertension, and radiation proctitis who presented
to the emergency department after sustaining an unwitnessed fall
this morning. The patient was moving from a commode to the bed
when she sustained a fall. The exact circumstances of this fall
are unclear. She does not remember experiencing any chest pain,
shortness of breath. The patient's son, who lives with her,
heard her fall and found her on the ground lying on her left
side. She was oriented and appropriate but complaining of severe
left arm pain.


In the ED initial vitals T 96.8, HR 72, BP 141/88, RR 16, O2 Sat
91% on RA. She went for radiographs, which revealed a left
femoral neck fracture, and then became hypotensive to 70s after
returning from radiology. She had some sensation of dizziness
and appeared pale but denied any localizing pain symptoms or
shortness of breath. She vomited once. After receving 3 L of IVF
her SBP's improved to the 90's but then drifted back down to the
70's. Serial ECG with baseline LVH but transient STE in V2. 1st
set of cardiac enzymes was negative. The patient endorsed mild
abdominal pain but denies chest pain, dyspnea, or presyncope.
She has had normal BM's. Vitals at time of signout T 96.5, AF
100-117, BP 80/45, RR 16, O2 97% on 2L.


Currently, she reports [**10-30**] left shoulder pain but denies any
chest pain, dyspnea, or other acute symptoms at this time.


Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems, she endorses chronic
minimally productive cough as well as mild abdominal pain and
loose stools related to her radiation proctitis. She denies any
prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock
or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

STUDIES:
SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLARY) TRAUMA LEFT Study Date of
[**2146-1-31**] 10:06 AM
FINDINGS: Total of two views of the left shoulder were obtained.
There is an acute fracture involving the left humeral neck with
impaction and slight medial displacement of the distal fracture
fragment. No additional fractures are seen.
IMPRESSION: Left humeral neck fracture.
.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2146-1-31**] 10:06 AM
FINDINGS: AP upright view of the chest is obtained. There is an
acute fracture involving the left humeral neck with a slightly
impacted appearance and medial displacement of the distal
fragment. Patient is rotated to left with a marked scoliotic
deformity, which limits evaluation through the chest, though
there is no definite evidence of lung consolidation, effusion,
or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly
stable. Bones are demineralized.
IMPRESSION: Left humeral neck fracture. Otherwise, no acute
findings.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2146-2-1**] at 9:42:07 AM
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve
leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Critical aortic stenosis. Moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with vigorous left ventricular systolic
function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-2-13**],
the calculated aortic valve area is smaller. The severity of
tricuspid regurgitation has increased. The previously seen small
secundum ASD is not well-visualized.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2146-2-2**] 7:47 AM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-1**], there is little
interval change on this somewhat limited study. Enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette persists with bibasilar atelectatic
change. There is suggestion of gas within a hiatal hernia. No
evidence of acute focal pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history significant for
CAD, critical AS, and radiation proctitis presenting after a
fall with a humeral fracture and hypotension following opiates.
.
# Hypotension: Patient was found to be hypotensive in the ED
after coming back from radiology study.  The etiologies for her
hypotension were thought to be related to pain-medications and
critical AS.  Patient was given gental IV fluid boluses after
being admitted to CCU.  Patient's blood pressure continued to be
low, systolics in the 60s and 70s, during the rest of her
hospital stay.  Pressors were avoided given her severe AS.
Because of hypotension, she developed acute renal failure
rapidly (creatinine bumped from 0.9 to 2.9 in 2 days).  Patient
declined hemodialysis, also denied AVR or valvuloplasty, so
after extensive discussions with patient's HCP (her son, [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 10166**]), decision was made to make patient comfort measures only.
She expired on day 3 of her hospital stay from acute renal
failure and electrolyte abnormalities.
.
# Critical AS: The patient had a previous valve area of 0.7cm2.
She underwent a repeat TTE which showed critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).  She declined AVR or
valvuloplasty.  She expired on [**2146-2-2**] in the setting of
critical AS, hypotension and acute renal failure.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Baseline Cr difficult to assess from labs
but appeared to be around 0.6-0.7.  Patient's creatinine was 0.9
on admission, likely prerenal in the context of appearing dry.
No recent antibiotics or other nephrotoxins, and no symptoms of
UTI with benign UA.  Patient was hypotensive during her hospital
stay.  As a result, her kidney function deteriorated rapidly.
Her creatinine bumped to 2.9 on day 3.  Patient declined
hemodialysis, so she was made comfort measures only after all
medical options to keep her alive failed.  On the morning of her
expiration, her K was 5.4, and she was not producing urine.  She
passed at 1900 that day.  It is therefore very likely that she
died of hyperkalemia.  On telemetry, she went into brief VT
followed by asystole minutes before her demise.
.
# Fall: Etiology of fall was unclear. The most concerning
possibility was that patient's AS led to syncope due to
hypoperfusion. Unfortunately, as the fall was unwitnessed and
the patient did not remember what happened this was impossible
to prove. Patient underwent a repeat TTE which showed critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).  Therefore, it was
certainly very likely that AS played a role in the fall.
.
# Humeral Fracture: Patient was seen by Orthopedics in the ED.
Ortho decided to manage conservatively with sling and analgesia.
Pain control was achieved with tylenol around the clock,
lidocaine patch, and low dose dilaudid with a goal to minimize
effect on blood pressure.  Patient's pain was well-controlled on
the above regimen.
.
# Rhythm: Patient was in atrial fibrillation, and not
anticoagulated. She was not on aspirin or coumadin because of a
previous GI bleed.  Metoprolol was held given her hypotension.
Patient was observed on telemetry during her hospital stay in
CCU.  She went into VT followed by asystole minutes before she
expired, likely secondary to hyperkalemia in the setting of
acute renal failure.
.
# Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology, though rapid increase and lack
of fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggested possibly
leukemoid reaction in the context of fracture and injury.
Cultures were negative, including blood cx, urine cx and c.diff.
 Patient was not started on antibiotics since she had no sign of
infection.
.
# Anemia: Patient had history of normocytic anemia, baseline
around 29-20.  Her hct was 43.6 on admission, likely
hemoconcentrated.  Hct decreased to her baseline of 29 during
the next two days.  She had no signs of active bleeding.
.
# CAD: Patient reported history of CAD, but with minimal details
and there are no caths in our system. Patient was not on ASA or
statin (lipids normal). Patient had some cardiac enzyme leaks
during her hospital stay, likely in the setting of hypotension
and decreased blood supply to coronaries.
.
# PPx: Patient was given subcutaneous heparin for DVT
prophylaxis.
.
# FEN: Patient was given cardiac healthy diet during this
hospital stay.
.
