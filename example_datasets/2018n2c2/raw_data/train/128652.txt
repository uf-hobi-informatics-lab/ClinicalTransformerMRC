HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year-old
gentleman with a history of Hodgkin's disease was transferred
here from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital because of intractable seizures
and decreased mental status.

He was in his usual state of health, active and playing golf,
until [**8-17**] when he began to become "confused" and developed
gait difficulties.  According to the family, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
behaving in a way that was perceived to be nontypical by family
members. [**Name (NI) **] was also having gait difficulties that were
considered to be mild, according to the family members.

Because of these symptoms, he was evaluated at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital
on [**8-17**]. At that time, a head computed tomography was
reported as normal. He was give a diagnosis of transient ischemic
attacks and was d/c home.

Over the next three days, Mr. [**Known lastname **] problems gradually
worsened.  On [**8-20**], he was at home when he developed a
nonfocal onset of seizure which was later generalized.    He
was transferred to the nearest Emergency Department where he
continued to have generalized seizures.  He was given a
Dilantin load and phenobarbital.  His systolic blood pressure
at that time ranged between 120 and 200s.

A repeat head CT was reported to be normal. Despite the Dilantin
load and the phenobarbiltal, the patient continued to have
clinical seizured. Therefore, he was started on an Ativan drip
and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. His Dilantin was
also continued on therapeutic levels.  Despite the Ativan drip
and Dilantin therapeutic levels, Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to be
unresponsive and had intermittent seizures. The rate of the
Ativan IV infusion was increased and the patient was intubated. A
lumbar puncture was performed on [**8-20**] at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital
and showed normal values.

A MRI with diffusion- weighted imaging showed diffuse
hyperintensity in the cerebral cortex (R > L) and both thalami.

At this point, the patient remained intubated and unresponsive
and was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
care.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hodgkin's disease diagnosed in [**2106-4-11**] after
developing a respiratory infection.  This was diagnosed as
nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease; stage III-B with
positive [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells.  A bone marrow biopsy was done
in [**2106-8-11**] which showed no bone marrow involvement.
2.  Status post chemotherapy with bleomycin, Cytoxan,
vincristine, and procarbazine two years ago.  This had to be
discontinued after three cycles because of interstitial lung
disease and because of myelosuppression with episodes of
neutropenic fever.  Most recent surveillance computed
tomography scan revealed gradual interval progression of
Hodgkin's disease with slightly large mediastinal lymph
nodes.
3.  Borderline hypertension.
4.  Colonic polyps.
5.  Tuberculosis.
6.  Cataracts.
7.  Macular degeneration.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin, Prevacid, and Tylenol.
Ativan drip and Dilantin were started at the outside
hospital.

ALLERGIES:  CEFTIN (causes a rash).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a retired chemistry teacher
and lived in [**Hospital3 **].  He was married with no alcohol or
intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was noncontributory.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2107-8-23**]. A repeat LP on admission showed normal cells, glucose
and protein. A CSF sample was also obtained for viral cultures
and different viral and fungal Ab titers (including West Nile
Virus, Arboviruses, HSV, HBVs). Routine cultures for bacterial,
TB and other infectious agents were also normal. Cytology was
normal.

Despite the therapeutic levels of PTN and the IV infusion of
Ativan, electroencephalogram (EEG) on admission showed
epileptiform sharp spike activity suggestive of ongoing
epileptict activity. Therefore, a Penotarbital infusion was
started. The Pentobarbital infusion was titrated to obtain a
burst- suppression pattern on bedside 24 h, EEG monitoring. In
particular, the EEG showed sharp waves complexes every 6 to 10
seconds. Dilantin and Depakote were continued as well. At this
point, pressors were started to compensate to the Pentobarbital-
induced decreased cardiac function.

Mr [**Known lastname **] condition did not improve and another magnetic resonance
imaging examination ([**8-24**]) showed multicentric areas of T2
hyperintensity with more concentration in the right frontal as
well as bilateral thalami. Laboratory studies throughout Mr.
[**Known lastname **] admission included several blood cultures, urine cultures
and extensive toxic metabolic workup. Another LP for
cerebrospinal fluid analysis for infection, toxic metabolic and
cytological analysis was also performed.

In order to better elucidate the underlying pathology. A brain
and meningeal biopsy was performed on [**8-24**] in the right
frontal lobe.

In regards to empiric treatment, after the brain biopsy, the
patient received IV Solu- Medrol and high doses of antibiotics
with broad coverage.  The Infectious Disease team was also
involved in the care of Mr. [**Known lastname **]. All the tests performed on his
tissues and fuids obtained under request of the ID team, had
thus far come back normal.

Brain and meningeal biopsy were remarkable for an meningitic
eosinophilic infiltrates and extensive ischemic cortical neuronal
damage (red neurons). There was no evidence of an infectious
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] on traditional staining and/or on electronic microscopy.

Several attempts in decreasing the dose of Pentobarbital resulted
in an increased epileptiform activity on bedside EEG monitor.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] condition deteriorated even further. He had developed
ileus, and his abdomen was hyperextended.  He had been intubated
throughout his entire stay in the Intensive Care Unit and was
increasingly dependent on ventilatory support.

At this point, the patient's  poor clincal status and prognosis
was thoroughly discussed with his closest family members. After
a family meeting, it was decided that Mr. [**Known lastname **] would no longer
benefit from aggressive support.  Therefore, he was extubated
and expired briefly thereafter.
