Service:  MED


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39-year-old
female with a history of [**Location (un) 2174**] ataxia and cardiomyopathy
with ejection fraction of 35 percent and diastolic
dysfunction with negative catheterization, atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin, and insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus, who was in her usual state of health until 2-3
weeks prior to admission she had episodes of nausea and
vomiting.  The patient also noted paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea and orthopnea with a 30-pound weight gain and
decreased urine output.  She was noted to have an INR of 19.5
on admission.  She was given vitamin K and admitted to the
Fennard Intensive Care Unit for concern for gastrointestinal
bleed.  The patient was also found to have nephrotic range
proteinuria and elevated LFTs.  Echocardiogram revealed
depression in her ejection fraction to 20 percent.  GI
Service was consulted and it suspected that her increasing
liver function tests were secondary to ischemic liver injury
with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertension.  The
Renal Service was consulted and felt her creatinine increase
and proteinuria may be secondary to underlying diabetic
nephropathy with severe right-sided heart failure.  She was
initially started on Lasix for her uncompensated congestive
heart failure, but her creatinine rose, so she was
transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] to initiate nesiritide
treatment.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.6, heart rate 66-78,
blood pressure 125-130/82-91, respirations 20, she is
saturating 100 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula.  Generally,
in mild respiratory distress, alert and oriented x 3.  HEENT:
Mucous membranes moist.  Obese neck.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary:  Bibasilar crackles.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
slightly distended, normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
Show total body 2 plus edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 14.2, hematocrit 41.7,
platelets 417, 93 percent neutrophils, 5 percent lymphocytes,
2 percent monocytes.  Sodium 140, potassium 5.1, glucose 140,
chloride 105, bicarbonate 20, BUN 20, creatinine 1.1, and
magnesium 2.  INR is 5.4 and PTT 34.3.  ALT is 915, AST
1,311.  Troponin T is 0.15, MB index is 3, MB is 12, and CK
is 397.  Alkaline phosphatase 114 and total bilirubin 3.1.

Chest x-ray on [**4-7**], shows congestive heart failure versus
bibasilar atelectasis.  Renal ultrasound shows unremarkable
left kidney, limited evaluation of the left.  No
hydronephrosis.  Normal echo texture.

Echocardiogram shows ejection fraction of 20 percent, severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis, severe global right
ventricular and free wall hypokinesis, 3 plus TR, mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Abdominal ultrasound shows normal liver echo texture,
hepatopetal portal venous flow.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Congestive heart failure:  The patient with
non-ischemic congestive heart failure associated with
[**Location (un) 2174**] ataxia with a recent worsening of her ejection
fraction to 20 percent.  The patient had mild elevation in
her cardiac enzymes, more consistent with atrial fibrillation
and hypotension in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  These enzymes trended down and
were not consistent with myocardial infarction.  The patient
was felt to be at risk for arrhythmia secondary to her severe
congestive heart failure and would likely need pacemaker
replacement in the future.  She was started on a Natrecor
drip due to her worsening renal function with Lasix.  She was
diuresed well with the Natrecor and the Congestive Heart
Failure Service followed her while she was in the hospital.
After several days of Natrecor diuresis, she was transitioned
to Lasix, although her creatinine rose to 2.1 and therefore
her Lasix was held for 1 day and her Lasix dose was
decreased.

Atrial flutter:  The patient has evidence of sick sinus
syndrome with occasional positives and is very sensitive to
beta-blockers.  She was started on dofetilide per the
Electrophysiology Service in an attempt to convert her to
sinus rhythm to improve her congestive heart failure.  The
patient did convert to sinus rhythm on dofetilide, although
her creatinine was unstable and rose to 2.1.  Therefore,
dofetilide was considered to be a poor antiarrhythmic choice
for her.  Per the Electrophysiology Service, there were no
other antiarrhythmic options and the patient will need to
follow up for a flutter ablation and if the flutter ablation
is unsuccessful, likely AV node ablation with pacemaker
placement.

Renal:  The patient was in nephrotic range proteinuria,
likely due to diabetic nephropathy.  The patient's creatinine
during her hospitalization rose to 2.1 and her Lasix dose was
subsequently decreased.  Because of her unstable creatinine
dofetilide was felt to be a poor antiarrhythmic for her.

Elevated LFTs:  There was no clear toxic etiology for
increased LFTs.  Her hepatitis A virus IgG was positive,
although all other hepatitis serologies were negative.
Acetaminophen level was negative.  This was felt to be either
related to transient hypotension in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] versus hepatic
congestion from congestive heart failure.  During her
hospitalization, her LFTs improved.

Urinary tract infection:  The patient with a positive UA, was
treated with levofloxacin.

Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus:  The patient was
followed by the [**Last Name (un) **] Service while an inpatient and started
on Lantus which was titrated up, and sliding scale insulin.

Depression:  The patient was with a history of severe
depression with suicide attempts.  She was continued on her
Paxil and during her hospitalization denied any suicidal or
homicidal ideations.

[**Location (un) 2174**] ataxia:  The patient was followed by Dr.[**Name (NI) 22985**]
team, the neurogeneticist, and initiated on coenzyme-Q
treatment while in hospital.  She will continue on this as an
outpatient and follow up with her neurologist.

care of her husband.
