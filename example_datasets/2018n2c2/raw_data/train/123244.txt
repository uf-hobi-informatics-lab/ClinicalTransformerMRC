History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70072**] is a 71 yo male who with a PMH of hypertension and
MI, who presents with back pain of 2 weeks duration.  He states
that he first noticed that something was wrong a couple of weeks
ago, after eating eating ice cream and drinking ice water at
night.  Later that night, after going to bed and falling asleep,
he was woken with a strange feeling which he describes as a
curtain descending down over his abdomen.  He states it felt as
if his body, in the region of his abdomen, had just shut down.
He fell back asleep the night, hoping that the strange feeling
would go away on its own.  Over the next few days, he began to
notice a pain in his upper back.  He describes that pain as
similar to a muscle spasm, in his back, that does not radiate.
When the pain first began, it was intermittent and could be
brought on by nearly anything, including getting up to walk and
eating.  He tried Advil and acetominophen which helped at first
to relieve his pain.  He noticed that his pain gradually became
more intense, and more intolerable.  He reports occasional chest
pain, shortness of breath, and feeling feverish when his pain
would become severe. At the time of presentation to an OSH, his
pain was constant, not relieved with Advil or acetominophen, and
he reports it as a [**9-26**].  He also developed a dry,
non-productive cough over the past 2-3 days, and a feeling of
nausea that developed when he would cough.  At times, when the
pain would become severe, he began to feel feverish and
developed sweats.  He reports that his last bowel movement was
nearly a week ago.  Patient reports that he was in Tripoli,
North [**Country 480**] in the [**2044**]'s during the Korean war.  Recalls one
episode of walking pneumonia, nearly 20 years ago, was not
hospitalized.  Recalls no episodes of hemoptysis.  He estimates
that he has lost ~10 pounds over the past two months due to
decreased appetite and pain with eating.  He denies chills,
night sweats, changes in vision, headache, shortness of breath,
chest pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, numbness,
parasthesias.

Pertinent Results:
MRI C/T/L spine [**2100-11-29**]:
MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITH GADOLINIUM:
There is no evidence of disc infection.  There is degenerative
disc disease at multiple levels.
At C4-C5, there is a small central disc protrusion without
evidence of canal or foraminal stenosis.
At C5-C6, there is a broad-based disc-osteophyte bar producing
moderate canal and moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.
At C6-C7, there is mild retrolisthesis producing moderate canal
and moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.  There is no evidence
of abnormal cord signal or abnormal cord enhancement.
IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative disease as described.
.
MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITH GADOLINIUM:
IMPRESSION:  Paraspinal mass with vertebral body involvement at
T7-T8.  There is involvement of the disc, and there is an
epidural mass.  The features in general suggest that this may be
a malignant process rather than an active infection, although
granulomatous disease would be an additional consideration.  The
findings are a bit unusual for bacterial abscess, but this is
not entirely excluded.
.
MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE:
IMPRESSION:  First degree spondylolisthesis at L5-S1.  Mild disc
bulging.  No evidence of focal disc protrusion.  No evidence of
a destructive mass or abscess in the lumbar region.
.
CT T-spine w/o contrast [**2100-11-30**]:
Again seen is destruction of the inferior one-half of T7 and
superior endplate of T8 with a large associated paraspinal mass.
 There is a small epidural component as well as retropulsion of
bone fragments into the
ventral part of the spinal canal.  The degree of cord
compression is better evaluated on the previous day's MRI.
Again noted is kyphotic angulation of the thoracic spine at this
locale.  No new abnormalities are identified. There are
emphysematous changes in the lungs.  Aortic calcifications are
identified.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2100-12-2**]:
CT ABDOMEN:  The gallbladder is distended likely due to fasting.
 However,
clinical correlation is recommended.  The liver, spleen, and
pancreas are
unremarkable.  The small 11-mm left adrenal gland nodule is not
well
characterized in this study.  The right adrenal gland is normal.
 Small
hypodense area at the interpolar region of the right kidney is
too small to be characterized.  Small and large bowel are
grossly unremarkable.  There is a moderate amount of stool
within the colon.  The appendix is within normal limits.  Severe
calcifications of the aorta.  All the major branches are patent.
 No free fluid or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
CT PELVIS:  Urinary bladder, distal ureters are unremarkable.
No free fluid or free air in the pelvis.  Calcifications within
the prostate. Small segment of chronic dissection involving both
proximal common ilia
arteries.
.
TTE [**2100-12-6**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. LVEF=55%.  The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with focal near akinesis of the basal half of the inferolateral
wall. The remaining segments contract well. Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild)
LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular cavity size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No systolic prolapse is seen. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is top
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR PA/Lateral [**2100-12-6**]:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence for pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural
effusions but no evidence for CHF. Small well defined nodular
density right lung base. Correlate with prior outside films if
available . Further evaluation, either by follow up plain
radiographs in approx 3 months or by CT is suggested.
.
Chest CT [**2100-12-7**]:
The multiple mediastinal lymph nodes are subcentimeter ranging
up to 9 mm in the right paratracheal, 8 mm in the outer
pulmonary, and 1 cm in subcarinal are.  There is no hilar or
axillary lymphadenopathy.  The aorta is calcified with
relatively thick mural plaques ranging up to 4 mm, some of them
ulcerated, for example in the proximal distending thoracic
aorta, series 2, image 26, 27; at the level of the aortic arch,
series 2, image 21; in the distending aorta, series 2, image 31.
 The extensive mural thickening also involve the origin of the
left subclavian and left carotid and innominate arteries.
The assessment of the lung parenchyma demonstrate mild
centrilobular emphysema involving predominantly the upper lobes.
 A focal thickening of the left fissure is 4.3 mm in length.
The bilateral pleural effusion is small with adjacent lung
atelectasis.  Additional area of focal pleural thickening is in
the right upper lobe, series 4, image 45.  No other lung nodules
or masses are identified.  The images of the upper abdomen
demonstrate normal liver, spleen, adrenals, pancreas and
kidneys.  The gallbladder is markedly distended measuring up to
6 cm in diameter with some high-attenuation of the posterior
portion suggesting vicarious excretion.
.
[**2100-12-17**] U/S:  IMPRESSION: Negative bilateral lower extremity DVT
study.
.
[**2100-12-27**] CXR:  IMPRESSION: Increase in size of left pleural
effusion and new relatively large area of consolidation in
lingula and left lower lobe since prior study of [**2100-12-24**].

.
[**2100-12-30**] CT CHEST:  IMPRESSION:
1. Decrease in size of a moderate left pleural effusion with
loculated components. High attenuation within a loculated fluid
collection in the left upper hemithorax suggests component of
possible hemothorax and is unchanged. No evidence of new or
active extravasation.
2. Ground-glass opacity at the left base consistent with
reexpansion edema in the setting of recent thoracentesis.
Bibasilar hydrostatic interstitial edema.
3. Stable appearance of postoperative change within the mid
thoracic spine as above.
4. Tiny left hydropneumothorax, likely secondary to recent
thoracentesis

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 71 yo male with history of coccygeal
fracture, and CAD, who presented with back pain of 2 weeks
duration, found to have a T7-T8 epidural mass on MRI. He
subsequently was found to have a MSSA osteomyelolitis, underwent
colpectomy and fusion, however his course was complicated by
post-op NSTEMI, bradycardic arrest (complete heart block), upper
extremity venous clot, and delerium.
.
## Epidural Mass:
Patient presented with back pain of increasing severity of 2
weeks duration, that he rated as [**9-26**] on admission. Patient had
decreased patellar reflexes but no other focal neurological
deficits, and back was non-tender to palpation. No leg weakness,
sensory deficits or bowel/bladder incontinence.  MRI on
admission showed an epidural mass at T7-T8 level with some
moderate cord compression.  CT spine confirmed this finding.
Found to have elevated ESR to 102 and CRP of 216 concerning for
infectious process. Based on imaging the differential of the
epidural mass was infection (bacterial abscess vs tuburculoma),
vs malignancy vs AV malformation. The patient denied any history
or exposure to TB, however he was in North [**Country 480**] in the [**2044**]'s
during the Korean war. Recalled one episode of walking
pneumonia, nearly 20 years ago, was not hospitalized. Recalls no
episodes of hemoptysis. The patient denied any history of
malignancy, however he has not seen a physician in many years.
Given the possibility of infection he was started on
broad-spectrum abx including Ceftriaxone, vancomycin and flagyl
IV.  He was afebrile.  Ortho spine followed the patient and he
was provided with a TLSO brace given his T7 collapse.  Serial
neurological exams were performed looking for signs of cord
compression and were normal.  On [**12-3**] the patient underwent
CT-guided biopsy of the mass and tissue was sent to microbiology
 and pathology.  Gram stain and culture returned positive for
GPC.  ID was consulted for further recommendations.  When
organisms were identified as Staph aureus the ceftriaxone and
flagyl were discontinued.  He was continued on vancomycin with
goal troughs 17-20.  When sensitivities returned MSSA the
vancomycin was switched to Nafcillin 2gm IV q4h.
.
ID recommended TTE given epidural abscess and murmur on exam
(unclear age given no regular medical care).  TTE showed no
evidence of endocarditis with no vegetations or abscesses.  A
TEE was not performed given the patient would require a long
course of antibiotics and TEE would not change the management.
A PPD was also placed given tuburculoma was in the differential
and was negative.  Additionally, AFB smear and stain were both
negative.  AFB culture is pending.  There was no evidence of
granulomas on CXR or chest CT suggestive of old TB infection.
.
Although the patient appeared to have an MSSA abscess, an
underlying process could not be excluded.  Given possibility for
underlying malignancy an SPEP/UPEP were sent. PSA was 1.0 and
chest CT showed no lung nodules. Path of epidural biopsy showed
inflammation. Given the location of the abscess and involvement
of T7-T8 vertebrae with T7 collapse, the patient was taken to
the OR for surgical spine debridement/stabilization by ortho
spine. He underwent two surgical procedures to debride and
stabilize his spine (please see op notes from [**12-10**] and [**12-13**]
for details).  He should complete a 6 week course of nafcillin
to end on [**2101-1-20**].  He has follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic on
[**2101-1-5**] and may need lifelong suppressive therapy.
.
## NTEMI - Two days after his second surgery, the patient
developed chest pain.  An EKG revealed lateral ST depressions.
The pain was relieved by nitroglycerine complicated by mild
hypotension.  His cardiac enzymes were positive with a troponin
T peak of 0.27. His CPK-MB was also mildly elevated to 12.  He
was conservatively managed particularly with regard to his
recent spine surgery.  His cardiac regimen was adjusted to
include aspirin, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and Imdur.
.
## Cardiac arrest - The patient's course was further complicated
by a bradycardic arrest leading to asystole.  This episode was
not captured on telemetry. He received CPR as his DNR status had
temporarily been changed peri-operative.  He was resuscitated
successfully without use of epinephrine, atropine, or
electricity.  He was initially stabilized after transfer to the
CCU but had a similar arrest twice the next morning each
following repositioning. Telemetry revealed complete heartblock.
 An externalized pacemaker was placed with a screw-in lead in
the RV as putting a permanent pacer in while the osteomyelitis
was being treated.  The bradycardia appears to have been
triggered by excessive vagal tone.  The day before discharge a
perm. pacemaker was placed and was interrogated by EP and found
to be working well.  He has follow up on [**2101-1-5**] with the
device clinic to further evaluate the pacer.
.
## Anemia: Patient was found to be anemic on admission.  No
baseline for comparison.  Fe studies suggestive of anemia of
chronic disease.  Patient reports no hemoptysis,
hematemesis,melena, or hematochezia. EBL from the surgery was
~500cc.  Late into his CCU stay, he developed guaiac positive
stool.  His Hct stabilized after transfusion.  He continued on a
PPI.  He can follow-up with his PCP for potential referral to GI
for colonoscopy as an outpatient.
.
## Delirium: The patient developed delirium attributed to
medications (narcotics and benzodiazepines), and disruption in
sleep-wake cycle and CCU psychosis.  He was found not to have
capacity to refuse life saving interventions.  His daughter
[**Name (NI) 2127**] [**Name (NI) 70073**] was appointed health care proxy.  The patient's
agitation was managed with nightly haldol with as needed haldol
as well.  Other sedating medications such as narcotics and
benzodiazepines should be avoided as much as possible. Once he
was transferred to the regular medical floor his delirium
improved and by discharge he no longer displayed any signs of
delirium.
.
## Constipation/diarrhea:  Patient had not had a bowel movement
in over a week when he presented.  He was started on an
aggressive bowel regimen given constipation and requirement of
large amount of narcotics.  This bowel regimen was weaned down
over the course of his hospital stay.  Since being on the
antibiotics, he has developed diarrhea and has a rectal tube in
place. The diarrhea could be from an infectious source vs. the
antibiotics themselves.  He was tested for C diff and found to
be negative x3.  A C diff B toxin has been sent and will be
followed up after discharge.
.
## Hypertension:  Patient has a history of hypertension but had
never been treated. BP was initially labile and elevated
readings seemed to correlate with pain.  When pain was better
controlled the patient's BP remained elevated with SBP 140-150
at times.  His blood pressure was controlled as above.
.
## Iliac artery dissections: Incidental finding on CT. Vascular
consult obtained. No evidence of peripheral vascular compromise.
 Vascular team recommended outpatient follow up in 6 months with
ultrasound.
.
## Upper Extremitiy DVT - The patient developed a clot in the
right cephalic vein in the setting of a RIJ central venous
catheter.  He was initially anticoagulated but this was held in
the setting of the GIB.  Warm compresses and arm elevation
should be used to limit propagation of the clot.  The patient
had a CTA of the chest that was negative for PE.
.
## Enterobacter in sputum - The patient did have a sputum
culture that revealed a pan-sensitive enterobacter cloacae.  He
did not have any clinical evidence of pneumonia (no fever,
normalizing WBC, no definitive consolidation on imaging).
Antibiotics, levofloxicin, directed at this bacteria were
started when he was noted to have an infiltrate on CXR and some
shortness of breath. He also developed a large pleural effusion
and underwent a thorocentesis.  The fluid was exudative and
likely related to the pneumonia although the gram stain was
negative (he has been on antibiotics).  The cytology is still
pending and should be followed up by his PCP.
.
## Elevated Creatinine - Creatinine was 1.6 on admission.
corrected following IVF.
.
## Prophylaxis: PPI, heparin converted to [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings and
pneumo-boots with slow GIB.
.
## FEN -Regular diet with 5x/day nutritional supplements with
ensure plus. Did have hypokalemia likely secondary to
medications and loose stools.  He will receive standing
potassium repletion and need potassium level checked shortly
after discharge to adjust the dose.
.
## CODE - DNR/DNI. patient's daughter [**Name (NI) 2127**] [**Name (NI) 70073**] was
appointed health care proxy during this admission.
.
## Dispo - discharged to rehab

Discharge Instructions:
You have been evaluated and treated for an infection in your
vertebral column.  You underwent 2 surgeries to remove as much
of the infection as possible and to stabilize the spine.
However, after the surgeries you had a small heart attack.  Your
course was further complicated by a very slow heart rate that
required a pacemaker to keep you rate fast enough.
.
Please take all medications as prescribed.
.
You will need to continue the nafcillin until [**2100-1-20**].  You
should follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2101-1-5**] as below to
determine if lifelong antibiotics will be needed.
.
You will need to schedule an appointment with ortho spine Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1352**] (number written below) in mid [**Month (only) **]. You must wear your
TLSO brace for 3months whenever you want to get out of bed and
walk around or sit in a chair. This helps to stablize your back
and is very important to keep from damaging you back.
.
Your new pacemaker is working well. You must keep your
appointment on Wed [**1-5**] at 10am to have it further evaluated.
With your new pacemaker, you must not raise your arm above your
head for 6 weeks.
.
You had some blood in your stool.  You will need an outpatient
colonoscopy in the future.
.
A CT scan of your abdomen saw some illiac artery dissections.
You should follow up with vacular surgery (see below) in 6
months for ultrasound to evaluate these further.

Followup Instructions:
1) Orthopedics: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1352**]. Please call the clinic to
