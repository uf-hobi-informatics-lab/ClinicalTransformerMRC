CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Presyncope.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old male who
presented with a one-week history of fatigue,
lightheadedness, and black tarry stools with occasional
bright red blood per rectum.  The patient is status post a
bicycle accident in the summer of [**2166**] and has been taking
ibuprofen 400 mg q. 4-6 hours for approximately one month.
He also reports band-like chest pain radiating from his back
consistent with his history of chronic back pain.  He also
has increased chest pain with deep breaths and with movement
but denies shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting or
significant diaphoresis.  Other review of systems is
noncontributory.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Status post bicycle accident in
summer [**2166**] resulting in chronic lower back pain and history
of herniated disk.  2. Hyperplastic polyp on colonoscopy
[**11-7**].  3. History of rheumatic fever.  4. Obstructive sleep
apnea.  5. Childhood polio.  6. Status post tonsillectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Neurontin (patient
self-discontinued secondary to sedative side effects).  2.
Ibuprofen 400 mg q. 4-6 hours p.r.n.  3. Prozac 20 mg p.o.
q.d.  4. Flonase.  5. Omega oils.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and is a former
executive.  He denies the use of tobacco.  He occasionally
drinks alcohol.  He does not use drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother has a history of coronary artery
disease and Addison's disease.  Father has a history of
valvular heart disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98, pulse 82, blood
pressure 105/66, respiratory rate 18 and 100% on room air.
The patient was a pleasant, well-developed, well-nourished
male in no acute distress.  His HEENT examination was normal
except for dry mucous membranes.  His neck was supple with 7
cm of jugular venous pressure.  His chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  He had a regular rate and rhythm
with a systolic murmur.  His abdomen was soft and
nondistended with mild epigastric tenderness and normal
active bowel sounds.  The patient had black stools that were
guaiac positive.  His extremities showed no pedal edema.
Pulses were +2 bilaterally.  Neurological examination was
grossly intact.  The patient was alert and oriented x 3.

Nasogastric lavage was deferred as EGD was to be done.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit was 24.3.  The remainder of the
patient's complete blood count, chem-10 and basic coagulation
studies were within normal limits.

EKG:  On admission the patient was in normal sinus rhythm
with a rate of 76, normal axis and intervals and no ischemic
changes.

Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or interstitial edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Upper GI bleed:  EGD performed on
[**2168-4-18**] revealed a normal EGD to the second part of the
duodenum.  In the second part of the duodenum a fresh clot
located between the duodenal bulb and the ampulla was noted.
After washings there was fresh bleeding that completely
obscured visualization.  Despite multiple attempts of
washings, therapeutic cautery was impossible with EGD.  Given
the brisk bleeding, an emergent artery embolization was
needed.  Interventional radiology performed an embolization
of the gastroduodenal artery and noted a pseudoaneurysm at
the entrance into the duodenum.  This was performed on
[**2168-4-18**].  The patient's hematocrit reached a nadir of 13.9
on [**2168-4-18**] and required six units of packed red blood cells
for resuscitation.  Following the embolization described
above the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit
remained stable at approximately 28.  The patient's diet was
advanced slowly 48 hours following the procedure without
complications.  Serial examinations were performed to
evaluate for ischemic colitis which revealed a completely
benign abdomen.

Gastroenterology followed the patient during the course of
admission and made several recommendations to decrease future
risks of GI bleeding, including Protonix b.i.d. for at least
two weeks and then continued q.d. thereafter, avoidance of
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Omega oils,
avoidance of alcohol and avoidance of coffee.

Prior to discharge, a repeat endoscopy was done to reevaluate
the region of active bleeding.  This was performed on
[**2168-4-21**] and revealed a shallow ulcer in the second part of
the duodenum.  Per gastroenterology, this region is stable
and the patient does not require further follow up from their
department unless there are signs of recurrent bleeding, such
as presyncope, bloody stools, melena, or hemodynamically
instability.  Helicobacter pylori was negative.

2. Chest pain:  The patient had the band-like chest pain on
presentation that was typical of his chronic pain.  The
patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction.  He had a
normal EKG.  Pain resolved with treatment of upper GI bleed
and with Ultram.

3. Back pain:  The patient was initiated on a treatment plan
with Ultram as an alternative to ibuprofen for chronic back
pain.  The patient states that he gained adequate relief with
this regimen and did not find any significant side effects in
the first few days to use.  He will be discharged with a
prescription for Ultram.  Tylenol may also be used.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Upper GI bleed.
2. Anemia secondary to blood loss status post six units of
packed red blood cells.
3. Melena.
4. Chest pain, not otherwise specified.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 216**], in one week.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Tramadol 50 mg p.o. q. 4-6 hours p.r.n.
3. Prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d.

PENDING STUDIES:  None.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is stable
hemodynamically.  His hematocrit is approximately 28.  He is
tolerating a regular diet.  He has no gross blood or melena
in the stool.  He has no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.
