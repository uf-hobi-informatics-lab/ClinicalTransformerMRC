Brief Hospital Course:
Initial plan for patient was to go to OR for repair of the
umbilical hernia. He has a new onset of ascites and there is
concern for erosion of hernia and/or infection. He was admitted
following hemodialysis.
On the morning of the intended surgery, his INR was 1.8 and PTT
42. Plan was to give Vitamin K pre-op and have FFP on call to
OR. During the infusion of the Vitamin K the patient suffered an
apparent anaphylactic reaction to the IV Vitamin K and he
required resuscitation to include intubation.
He was transferred to the ICU where he was stablized, and
ultimately extubated.
He was transferred back to the surgical floor. However it was
felt that the risk of the operative procedure would outweight
the benefit of fixing the hernia, so it was determined to send
the patient home without the hernia repair.
He is to wear an abdominal binder at all times, one was provided
to the patient prior to discharge.
He will continue on his usual home medications and be followed
by the liver team as he has been prior to this admission. He
will also continue his hemodialysis per outpatient schedule.
