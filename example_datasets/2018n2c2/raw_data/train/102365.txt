History of Present Illness:
76 year old female with h/o IPF on chronic prednisone, COPD with
trach, CHF, mechanical mitral valve, pacemaker, and anemia who
presents with several days of worsening dysypnea, peripheral
edema, and fatigue. She reports difficulty walking very short
distances due to SOB and lightheadness frequently. She reports
[**2-28**] pillow orthopnea that remains unchanged from baseline. She
reports frequent productive cough that occasionally is bloody,
last bloody sputum was this morning. She reports frequency of
cough and sputum production is same as baseline. She believes
she has had an unknown amount of weight gain.  Peripheral edema
fluctuates in severity. She denies changes in bowel habits and
denies changes in urination. She denies changes in appetite,
denies fever, chills, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, melena, and BRBPR.She denies sick contacts and recent
travel.

Images:
[**10-7**] Chest AP: Low lung volumes with known idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis. While a subtle superimposed acute consolidation in the
lung bases is difficult to exclude, it would be highly
coincidental and is felt less likely with the increased opacity
likely due to crowding.

CXR ([**10-8**]):
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Status post sternotomy, status post valvular
replacement. The
external and internal pacemaker with leads are visible.
Unchanged evidence of a right basal opacity with a predominantly
reticular pattern, that might, in part be, fibrotic.  These are
likely to be related to the known history of idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis. There is no evidence of fluid overload on
the current image. No pleural effusions. No parenchymal
opacities have newly occurred.
.
CT Torso: [**10-27**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis with mild bibasilar
consolidations, worse on the right than the left, likely
reflecting atelectasis, although
superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
2. Status post right mastectomy.
3. Cholelithiasis in a nondistended gallbladder with mild wall
edema/pericholecystic fluid likely reflects either CHF or
hypoproteinemia.
4. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
5. No evidence of intra-abdominal free air or organized fluid
collection.
6. Indistinct pancreatic head; correlate with pancreatic enzymes
if clinical concern for pancreatitis.
.
RUQ US [**10-25**]
1. Sludge and stones in the gallbladder neck without other
findings to
suggest acute cholecystitis. If there is continued clinical
concern, a HIDA scan may be more definitive in the exclusion of
acute cholecystitis.
2. Dilated hepatic veins consistent with diastolic dysfunction
.
CT Head [**10-20**]
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Small vessel ischemic disease and diffuse cerebral atrophy.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y.o woman with PMH of IPF,COPD,anemia, mechanical mitral
valve,and pacemaker presents with worsening dyspnea, acute renal
failure, and fluid overload.

#. Anemia: On admission hemoglobin of 4.6 and hematocrit of 14.2
from a
hgb 10 and hct 33.1 within the last several weeks. Hemolysis
labs negative, and rectal exam showed guiac positive brown
stool. Her anemia was believed to be secondary to a GI bleed.
She was transfused 4 units total with appropriate hct response,
and her hct/hgb ramined stable. She underwent EGD/colonoscopy
which showed esophageal and fundal varices and a large polyp in
the colon, concerning for malignancy which was believed to be
the source of bleeding.  On biopsy, this lesion was found to be
an adenoma with high grade dysplasia. Gastroenterology believed
that it would be possible to perform a transluminal resection
but that the procedure would have high risk of perforation and
death. After a goals of care discussion with the [**Hospital 228**]
health care proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 15155**], and the gastroenterology team
it was decided that though the adenoma is high risk for
malignancy, she will likely succumb to her severe pulmonary
disease in the next 1-5 years and removal of the mass is not in
line with her goals of care. She was started on nadolol for
esophageal varaces.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Obtain 2x weekly HCTs and transfuse for HCT <21
-- Continue Fe supplementation and epo administration
.
#. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient presented on 5L
trans-trach from a baseline of 4L at home in the setting of
known IPF, COPD, and chronic heart failure.  Her dyspnea was
attributed to anemia vs fluid overload from CHF, and remained
stable in-house and gradually improved upon discharge from the
ICU.  There was low suspicion for a COPD or IPF exacerbation.
She was given IV Torsemide for diuresis with her packed red cell
transfusions, and her home Bumex was held in-house.  Her home
prednisone and nebulizers were continued in-house.  Related to
her shortness of breath, she occassionally coughed up "blood
balls", which she attributed to bloodly mucous originating at
her catheter site.  These were inconsistent, and associated with
epistaxis, and we believed that there was a component of bloody
post-nasal drip contributing, exacerbated by the fact that she
was on a heparin gtt for her heart valve.  The total blood loss
from these episodes was essentially non-contributory.  On the
floor, she continued to be dyspneic at times.  She was found to
have evidence of a RUL HAP, so she was started empirically on
vancomycin and cefepime. She developed progressive respiratory
distress and returned the MICU where she was intubated. She
underwent broncheoalveolar lavage which was culture negative and
her antibiotics were discontinued on [**10-23**]. She continued to be
intermittently diuresed but it was stopped when her creatinine
bumped from 1.8 to 2.7. She was extubated and returned to the
medical floor with o2 sats 95% on 2LNC The thought is that her
respiratory distress was likely due to a mucus plug and
pulmonary edema. After two days on the medical floor, she pulled
out a nasogastric tube which had been used for tubefeeds,
aspirated and developed respiratory distress with hypoxia and
acidemia. She was transferred to the MICU for a third time where
she was again intubated. Out of concern for HCAP the pt was
started on vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]. Due to increasing wbc and decreased stool
output there was also concern for c.diff, which ultimately was
positive, and the pt was started on flagyl/PO vanc. The pt's
respiratory status improved and she was successfully extubated.
Vancomycin was discontinued on [**10-30**] with plan to complete a
total of 8d of meropenem.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Continue meropenem thru [**11-3**].
-- Ongoing discussion regarding replacement of transtracheal
catheter.
.
#Clostridium Difficile: The pt was found to have a rising WBC,
episodes of hypotension and decreased stool output. She was
empirically started on IV flagyl and PO vanco which were
continued when stool culture was positive for c.diff. Pt had
subsequent decreased in WBC to normal with improvement in loose
stools.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Plan to complete PO vancomycin 125mg PO Q6hrs as well as
Flagyl 500mg Q8hrs; end date [**11-9**].
.
#Anticoagulation: Patient anticoagulated due to presence of
mechanical valve. Patient presented with an INR of 10 for
unclear reasons.  She received 5mg PO Vit K, and her INR
down-trended to the sub-therapeutic range and she was started on
a Heparin gtt for her mechanical mitral valve.  She experienced
epistaxis and coughed up bloody mucus in the setting of a
slightly supratherapeutic PTT which resolved with decreasing her
Heparin gtt.  She was kept on a heparin drip for bridging on the
medicine floor.  When the decision was made to pursue
endomucosal resection of her adenoma, her warfarin was
discontinued, however given this was put on hold, the pt was
restarted on coumadin [**10-29**]. At time of discharge patient
remained on hep gtt as well as coumadin 3mg daily; INR on day of
discharge 1.9
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- COntinue hep gtt and coumadin until INR therapeutic (2.5 -
3.5).
.
#Volume Status/Acute Renal Failure. Patient with oscillating
renal function in house. Peak   Cr 2.8 from a baseline of ~1.4,
likely secondary to hypovolemia as well as renal hypoperfusion
[**2-27**] anemia.  Urine lytes showed were consistent with
hypovolemia. Initially Bumex was held and she was given IV
hydration. Creatinine increased from 1.8-2.7 in the setting of
diuresis (as above) and bumex was held. During hospital stay
patient was intermittently diuresised and prior to discharge
restarted on PO Bumex 5mg daily with creatinine of 1.7. Weight
at time of discharge: 62.4kg ; sating >95% on 5L NC.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Pleae continue Bumex 5mg PO daily; monitor weights daily as
well as renal function; may consider increasing bumex to [**Hospital1 **] or
transitioning to IV if weight increases >3lb
.
# Esophageal Varices. Newly diagnosed. Patient placed on nadolol
10mg daily.
.
# Hypertension. Patient largely hypotensive to normotensive in
house. Decision made to hold home amlodipine 5mg daily as well
as spironolactone 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at time of discharge.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Close hemodynamic monitoring; plan to re-initiate
anti-hypertensives if needed.
.
# Pulmonary fibrosis. Patient with transtracheal O2 catheter as
well as use of chronic steriods as an outpatient. During 1st
intubation transtracheal cath was removed. In house patient
received stress dose steriods which were weanted to home
prednisone 10mg daily at time of discharge.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Continue chronic prednisone; consider need for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
[**Name9 (PRE) **] Continue discussion re replacement of transtracheal cath
.
# Hypernatremia. Patient noted to be intermittently
hypernatremic when NPO/intubated. Received free water boluses
thru NGT as well as IV D5 with improvement. Na at time of
discharge 152
OUTPATIENT
-- Continue monitoring of electrolytes; encourage PO intake and
adminster D5W if needed (however by cautious in setting of known
diastolic CHF).

# Goals of Care: On [**2137-10-25**] a goals of care discussion was held
with the patient's HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 15155**]. The decision was made to
forgo aggressive management of the colonic adenoma as her life
expectancy with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (which she has
suffered with for ~8 years) is now less than 5 years and likely
less than one. The family wanted the patient to remain full code
and to have aggressive management of her pulmonary disease.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms [**Known lastname **] it was a pleasure taking care of you.

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of GI bleed and while
in house you developed respiratory compromise requiring
intubation.
.
Regarding the GI bleed, you were seen by our team of GI doctors
who performed a colonscopy. During the procedure a colonic
lesion was seen and a plan was devised to proceed for excisional
biopsy. You were transfused RBCs as needed and your blood counts
were monitored closely. After discussion with your family the
decision to undergo biopsy was deferred to the outpatient
setting.
.
While in house your breathing became labored on several
occassions which required intubation twice. The cause of the
distress included aspiration and possible pneumonia. You were
started on antibiotics with a plan to complete an 8d course.
Your transtracheal catheter was removed with plan to discuss
replacement as an outpatient. At time of discharge you were
oxygenating well using supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal
cannula.

Also you were noted to have an infection in your GI tract and
were started on antiobiotics to eradicate this bacteria.

Prior to discharge you were feeling much improved and the
decision was made to transition to a nursing facility/rehab
where you can work to optimize strength, mobility and nutrition.
.
CHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATIONS:
START 10mg Nadolol daily for gastric varices
CONTINUE MEROPENEM until [**2137-11-3**]
CONTINUE VANCOMYCIN AND FLAGYL until [**2137-11-9**]
