Chief Complaint:
Biliary obstuction.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP
IR guided biliary drain

History of Present Illness:
This is an 88 yo man transferred from OSH [**11-4**] for ERCP for
biliary obstruction with obstructive hepatopathy. presented to
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**11-3**] with increasing shortness of breath,
dizziness, and jaundice. Per OSH also reported fevers, chills,
and nausea. Had gveen given bactrim for a UTI one week prior. He
underwent an abdomen CT which showed intrahepatic and
extrahepatic obstruction likely secondary to metastatic cancer
to the pancreatic head. He was started on flagyl, zosyn, and
vanc and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.

While being prepped for ERCP (while under MAC) and turned prone
he regurgitated coffee-brown material so he was electively
intubated due to concern for his risk of aspiration. They
proceded with ERCP, but were unable to cannulate the biliary
tree. A dudodenal stent was placed due to external compression
of the duodenum. He was placed on propofol for sedation and his
SBP's dropped to the 80's in the PACU. He was started on neo
through a PIV for pressure support.

In the ICU the neo was rapidly weaned and he was extubated
easily [**11-5**]. It was thought that his inability to extubate
post-procedure and hypotension were due to sedation rather than
aspiration given his rapid improvement.

ROS: 10 point review of systems negative except as noted above.

CXR port [**11-4**]: Lung volumes are quite low. With the chin down,
the tip of the ET tube at the upper margin of the clavicles is 3
cm above optimal placement. [**Month (only) 116**] be left hilar enlargement and
one or more nodules in the left lung. A band of atelectasis is
present at the base of the right lung which is otherwise clear.
Heart is mildly enlarged. No pneumothorax. Small bilateral
pleural effusions, left greater than right, are likely present.
An apparent bulge in the right mediastinal contour could be a
skin fold instead. Repeat radiographs, conventional if possible,
recommended when feasible.
.
ERCP [**11-4**]: A large amount of gastric fluid was found when the
endoscope was passed into the stomach, suggestive of outflow
tract obstruction.
Unable to pass the scope to the second part of the duodenum due
to obstruction, most likely extrinsic compression from colon
cancer metastases. A duodenal stent ( 9cm x22mm Wallflex enteral
duodenal stent) was placed successfully under fluoroscopic
guidance to alleviate the gastric outlet obstruction. Ref 6502.

Fluoro [**11-6**]:
IMPRESSION: Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram
demonstrating moderate
intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation with
obstruction of the
common bile duct at the level of the ampulla. Successful
placement of a right transhepatic internal-external biliary
draining catheter with the catheter connected to a bag for
external drainage


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 88 yo male with pmh of metastatic colon
cancer and hypertension who is being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to
hypotension and need for continued intubation s/p ERCP attempt
for biliary obstruction.
.
# Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive after intubation on
propofol. Likely secondary to propofol, however also in the
differential is hypotension from sepsis. He has two potential
sources for sepsis: biliary obstruction and recent apsiration.
Also could have volume depletion. Since coming to the floor his
pressures had recovered and phenylephrine weaned off. Given the
possibility of sepsis, he was started on vancomycin, flagyl and
cefepime, but then changed to ceftriaxone and flagyl.  The
vancomycin was discontinued after the cultures were negative x
48 horus.  On the day before discharge he was transitioned to PO
levofloxacin to complete a full course through [**11-11**], cultures no
growth to date at discharge.
.
# Biliary obstruction/obstructive jaundice: The patient
underwent a CT at the OSH which showed intrahepatic and
extrahepatic bile duct dilatation likely due to a metastasis to
the pancreatic head from his colon cancer. He failed ERCP due to
external compression of the duodenum limiting their ability to
pass the scope.  A duodenal stent was placed by the ERCP team to
help to decompress the gastric outlet obstruction.  Given the
failed ERCP attempt, IR was consulted and performed an IR guided
biliary drain on [**2199-11-6**].  He was transferred to the floor and
his LFTs trended down after the stent was placed.  His drain was
clamped on [**11-8**] and with continued improvement of his liver
tests and symptoms.  He was discharged with a clamped biliary
drain to follow up with interventional radiology.  If symptoms
return, the drain can be unclamped to a bag.
.
# Respiratory distress: The patient presented to the ICU
intubated since the ERCP. On the following morning he was
successfully extubated and breathing appropriately on room air.
.
# Anemia, chronic disease: The patient was noted to have
coffe-ground regurgitation during the ERCP procdure. He was
anemic with a Hct of 26 at the OSH and 25 on admission labs
here. Vit B12 and folate normal at the OSH. Fe low, but other Fe
studies not sent. Haptoglobin high makes hemolysis unlikely.
Most likely due to anemia of chronic disease and possibly due to
oncologic treatment. Started an IV PPI due to concern for coffee
ground regurgitant.  His hematocrits were stable and did not
need transfusions.
.
# Metastatic colon cancer: Patient has multiple mets seen on OSH
imaging. He will follow up with his outpatient surgeon after
discharge.
.
# Hypertension, benign: stable

Discharge Condition:

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital becuase you had an obstruction
in the small bowel and also in your biliary tract.  You went for
a procedure that stented open your small bowel allowing you to
eat liquids and solids.  You then went to the have a drain
placed in your biliary duct in order to the relieve the
obstruction.

Resume all of your home medications except Lipitor, until follow
up with your doctors.

You will need to continue the levofloxacin for 7 days until
[**2199-11-11**].  You will need to follow up with your primary surgeon
and your primary care doctor.  Additionally, interventional
radiology will contact you to follow up with your drain
management.

Return to the hospital if you experience fevers/chills,
abdominal pain, recurring jaundice, or any other concerning
symptoms.

Followup Instructions:
As above, you will need to follow up with your primary surgeon,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25804**] when you return home, as well as with your PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 25237**] as soon as possible.

You will also need to follow up with the interventional
radiology department in order to change the drain in 3 months.
They will contact you to schedule this.
