Chief Complaint:
N/V, Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
85F with hx of COPD, CHF, esophageal ulcer, and significant
restless leg syndrome transferred from OSH for further
management of abdominal pain and fevers concerning for acute
cholecytitis c/b sepsis. Patient was in her USOH until Sunday
evening when she developed abdominal pain, non-bloody vomiting,
and nausea. She describes the pain as sharp and crampy with
severity ranging from [**2121-4-26**] pain with inability to take PO's
since Sunday afternoon. She denies sick contacts at her nursing
home but does state that there's been a stomach bug going
around. She presented to [**Hospital6 19155**] earlier today
where her initial VS were 98.2, 92, 179/92, 24, 92%RA. Labs
notable for WBC of 21.3K, 83 segs, 0 bands, K of 3.3, Cr 0.9,
Dig < 0.04, lactate 2.9, LFT's and lipase wnl's, UA with 3+
bacteria, [**2-22**] wbc's, rare epis. She rec'd K repletion with
40meq, 1L NS, duoneb x 1, zosyn 3.25g x 1, atarax, and underwent
CT abd/pelv (report not in chart) which per report showed
massive retrocardiac hernia, markedly distended GB,
pericholecystic fluid suggesting calculous cholecystitis. RUQ
U/S showed thick GB wall but no stones. She was transferred here
for further management.

ED Course: Initial VS - 100.6, 110, 166/100, 16, 97%2LNC
-Labs: 20.9WBC's, no bands, lactate 2.4, INR 1.0, BUN/Cr 15/1.0,
K 3.8, LFT's wnl's, lipase 21.
-EKG: NSR @ 118, NI, leftward axis, Q-waves in II, AVF, poor
r-wave progression, no old priors on record
-RUQ U/S: No stones, extra- and intra-hepatic biliary ducts with
the common bile duct measuring up to 10 mm.
-CXR: Large hiatal hernia, hyperinflated lungs, fibrotic
pattern, no clear pleural effusions or infiltrates
-Evaluated by surgery in the ED who felt given her presentation
c/w cholecystitis/possible cholangitis but given comorbidities
that she is an overall poor surgical candidate and recommended
admission to medical service with percutaneous drainage by IR.
-Admitted to MICU for further management

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS 99.2, 112, 162/84, 25,
96%2LNC. She confirms the above history and complains of mild
headache. She otherwise denies chest pain, shortness of breath
beyond her baseline, sore throat, cough, sinus tenderness, neck
or back pain, urinary symptoms, or extremity discomfort other
than her restless leg syndrome.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
================

[**2123-4-8**] HIDA SCAN:
IMPRESSION: Normal hepatobiliary scan. No evidence of
cholecystitis.

[**2123-4-7**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Mild global atrophy with mild chronic microvascular ischemic
disease.

[**2123-4-7**] CT TORSO WITH CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Dilation of the gallbladder is nonspecific without
accompanying secondary signs of cholecystitis.
2. No definitive acute infectious process identified.
3. Large left hemidiaphragmatic defect without definitive
evidence of bowel obstruction or strangulation. Equivocal fat
stranding is seen here and the contrast column has not cleared
this point-delayed plain film might be useful
4. Marked demineralization accompanied by severe degenerative
changes of the spine and hips. Multiple age indeterminate
thoracic compression fractures.

[**2123-4-6**] CHEST (PA & LAT):
IMPRESSION: Large retrocardiac left mid-to-lower hemithorax
opacity with
areas of lucency with appearance of bowel and possibly stomach,
likely related to large hernia possibly containing bowel, not
well evaluated on this study, no priors for comparison. Minimal
right base atelectasis.

[**2123-4-6**] RUQ U/S:
IMPRESSION: Distended gallbladder without evidence of stones.
There is mild prominence of the extra- and intra-hepatic biliary
ducts with the common bile duct measuring up to 10 mm. However,
the patient has an equivocal [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign post-medication as
demonstrated by the attending radiologist. Acalculous
cholecystitis can not be excluded in the appropriate clinical
setting.

Brief Hospital Course:
85F with a history of CHF, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis who presents
with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain since Sunday. Imaging
at OSH significant for likely cholecystitis. Deemed poor
surgical candidate so transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of
percutaneous drainage by IR.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:

# CHOLECYSTITIS: On arrival patient was with high-grade
leukocytosis, fever, and significant abdominal pain and nausea.
She was admitted to the MICU for concern for evolving sepsis.
She underwent RUQ U/S here with findings that could be
consistent with acalculous cholecystitis. She was evaluated in
the ED by general surgery who felt she was not an ideal
operative candidate and suggested HIDA scan and evaluation by IR
for percutaneous cholecystostomy. EGD also evaluated her but
deferred to IR given the lack of obstructive findings on her
LFT's. CT torso and HIDA scan were negative for cholecystitis
but did demonstrate dilated gall bladder. CT torso also
demonstrated known large diaphragmatic hernia with stomach and
bowel in the left chest with mild stranding and old PO contrast
from OSH possibly c/w recent inflammation of the intrathoracic
bowel. IR thus felt there would be little benefit from
intervention. Patient was started on vanc/zosyn, became
abdominal pain free, afebrile, with a downtrending white count
and was called out to the floor for further management. The
patient did well on the floor. Her vancomycin was discontinued.
She remained on zosyn and completed a 7-day course in house.
Symptoms resolved at the time of discharge.

# TRANSIENT SOMNOLENCE: Patient has multiple late morning
episodes of transient somnolence with normal finger sticks,
normal ABG's, and no clear seizure activity. She had a CT head
which was negative for acute process. This was thought to be the
result of oversedation from meds (IV morphine, klonopin PRN, PM
amitryptiline, and antiemetics). Her level of alertness
spontaneously resolved following these episodes.

# DIARRHEA - On the floor the patient had a number of episodes
of diarrhea. A C. Diff was negative. She was maintained on IVF.
Her vancomycin was stopped as above. The patient's bowel regimen
was stopped. The diarrhea improved.  Bowel regimen may be
resumed as outpatient PRN.

# DEPRESSION: The patient endorsed acute on chronic decrease in
appetite long with insomnia and anhedonia.  This was felt to  be
due to worsening depression.  Nutrition evaluated her and felt
that she need maximal supplementation of her diet.  The
psychiatry team evaluated her while she was in the hospital and
started mirtazapine 7.5 mg QPM (1 hour before meals). On the
last evening of her admission she was able to sleep.  Her
depression should be monitored while on this medication for
signs of improvement.  She warrants ongoing evaluation of her
symptoms and medications.  At the moment she appears well
nourished, but if her diet and appetite do not improve with
treatment of her depression then nutrition felt she might
require tube feeds and evaluation for PEG tube.  This was
briefly discussed with her son, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 110281**].  Given that she is
still recovering from an acute abdominal insult, it was felt
that further evaluation could take place on an outpatient basis.


# URINARY RETENTION: The patient was noted to have problems with
urinary retention after having her Foley pulled.  IF she does
not produce urine she will need to be bladder scanned and
possibly straight cathed if scanned for > 500.  At the time of
discharge she was incontinent of urine.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:
# COPD: Treated for exacerbation with rapid steroid taper in
early [**Month (only) 547**]. No active wheezing on exam. Continued on nebs
in-house.

# CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF: LVEF >75%. On home furosemide and
digoxin which were initially held. Pt's digoxin level non-toxic
on admission.  Given poor PO intake, her lasix was held at the
time of discharge.  It can be resumed at her nursing home once
deemed appropriate after assessment of her volume status by a
physician.

# GLAUCOMA: Stable. Continued on Lumigan 0.3% OU QHS

# DEPRESSION/ANXIETY/RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME: Chronic issue for
her. Her home klonopin was dose-reduced PRN but she was
continued on her home amitryptiline and citalopram.

# POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA: On chronic prednisone. No evidence of
adrenal insufficiency. Continued on prednisone 5mg PO daily
in-house as well as calcium and vitamin D.

# HTN: Restarted on metoprolol after infectious process
resolved.
