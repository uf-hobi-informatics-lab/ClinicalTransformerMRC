Valve.
[**2142-8-16**] Re-exploration for Bleeding


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7842**] is a 47 year old male who presented to OSH with left
sided chest pain, dizziness and diaphoresis while showering. CTA
revealed Type A aortic dissection. He was emergently med

Denies tobacco but admits to occasional marijuana. Denies
history of ETOH abuse.

Family History:
No premature coronary artery disease.

Physical Exam:
At the time of discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 7842**] was found to be awake,
alert, and oriented.  His heart was of regular rate and rhythm.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His sternal
incision was clean, dry, and intact.  His sternum was stable.
His abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended.  +1 edema
was noted in his extremities.

Pertinent Results:
[**2142-8-14**] Intraop TEE:
PREBYPASS - The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%) Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The ascending aorta is markedly dilated.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. A mobile
density originating from the right sinus of Valsalva is seen in
the ascending aorta, transverse arch and descending thoracic
aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. POSTBYPASS - LV systolic function remains normal. There is
a well seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic
position. There is mild valvular AI. A graft appears in the
ascending aorta and transverse arch. The disection flap is still
present in the distal arch and descending thoracic aorta. Flow
is visualized in the true lumen. The study is otherwise
unchanged from prebypass.
[**2142-8-15**] Renal Ultrasound: No renal arterial abnormality detected.
Normal renal arterial waveforms.
[**2142-8-19**] Head MRI: Probable chronic small vessel infarct within
the inferolateral aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7842**] was emergently brought to the operating room where
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed replacement of his ascending aorta and
subtotal arch along with aortic valve replacement. For surgical
details, please see seperate dictated operative note. Following
the operation, he was brought to the CVICU in critical
condition. Initially coagulopathic, he required multiple blood
products. Postoperative TEE was notable worsening pericardial
effusion with questionable signs of early tamponade. He
concomitantly had a slight decline in renal function. Renal
ultrasound showed no evidence of aortic dissection into the
renal arteries. On postoperative day two, he returned to the
operating room for re-exploration. Given prolonged period of
sedation and intubation, tube feedings were started for
nutritional support. As sedation was weaned he became extremely
agitated with question of nonpurposeful movements. Head CT scan
and MRI were obtained which did not show any large area of
territory infarct. Neurology service was consulted and
attributed his altered mental status to most likely
toxic-metablolic encephalopathy. He remained hypertensive and
continued to require Labetolol drip for adequate blood pressure
control. He also experienced postop fevers, and pan-cultures
were obtained. He was empirically started on antibiotics for
possible ventilator associated pneumonia along with positive
blood cultures. Over several days, clinical improvements were
noted. He was eventually extubated on postoperative day nine. He
was transferred to the step down floor.  He was seen in
consultation by the physical therapy service.  He was gently
diuresed.  A PICC line was placed and he was screened for rehab.
 By post-operative day 15 he was ready for discharge to rehab.
