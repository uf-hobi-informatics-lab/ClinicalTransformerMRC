Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the West 2b service on [**2154-1-1**].
Initially patient was managed in the ICU and kept NPO/IVF and
pain was treated. On [**1-4**], patient was deemed stable to come to
the floor after pancreatic labs and bilirubin began to trend
down.

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout his
hospitalization; In the ED, patient was given IV Dilaudid for
pain with good effect. Upon transfer to the unit, fentanyl was
started due to rash from Dilaudid. This seemed to control the
patient's pain well. When patient transferred to floor, Pain
service was consulted to control pain. They recommended Roxicet,
which provided good relief for the patient.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint. Vital signs were routinely monitored. BP was
slightly low in the ED with SBP in the high 90, however this
improved substantially with adequate hydration.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization.
GI/GU/FEN: Patient was kept nothing by mouth with intravenous
fluid upon admission to the hospital, but was advanced to stage
3 upon transfer to the general surgical [**Hospital1 **], which he tolerated
without increased pain or nausea. CT scan was performed in the
ED which showed acute uncomplicated pancreatitis and
cholelithiasis, but no signs of cholecystitis. Large ventral
hernia was also seen on CT scan. Labs were trended throughout
hospital course, which showed continuous drop in pancreatic
enzymes. However bilirubin continued to rise with a peak total
bilirubin of 4.4 on HD. ERCP was consulted, but they were unable
to perform the procedure due to patient's altered anatomy from
bypass surgery. MRCP on [**1-3**] showed no intra or extrahepatic
dilation, and no stone was seen. Bilirubin and other labs
continued to trend down and patient was transferred to the floor
on [**1-4**]. Labs continued to trend downward throughout the
remainder of her hospitalization;
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of
infection, of which there were none. Patient was not started on
any antibiotics upon admission to the hospital.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and [**Last Name (un) **]
dyne boots were used during this stay; he was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a stage 3
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.  He will return for an open
cholecystectomy and hernia repair on [**2154-1-14**].
