History of Present Illness:
76 year old female with h/o hypothyoidism, HTN/HLP, AAA repair
in past with notable known lung adenoCA and new RLL lung mass
which has enlarged in size over the last 4 months, being
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in oncology, was discharged yesterday
after admission for bronchoscopy, c/b pneumothorax for which a
pigtail was placed (removed at time of discharge). Tonight was
home, noted to have increased cough with rusty colored sputum
and fever to 102. Also seemed to be more lethargic to family
members. FSG 97 for EMS. Sats low 90's on 3L nc.
.
ED Course: Initial Vitals/Trigger: 102, 97/37, 17, 94% 6L nc.
Chest xray notable for possible increased patchy opacity R lung.
Labs notable for WBC 16.7 (N 82.2), Na 128, Creat 2.1, lactate
0.9, Hct 29.2. UA wnl. Sputum, blood, and urine cultures sent.
She was given 3L IVF NS, and started on empiric IV abx coverage
with cefepime 1g, vancomycin 1g, and levofloxacin 750mg IV. She
received benadryl for extremity erythema and itching during
peri-administration with vancomycin - slowed rate of infusion as
well. She received tylenol for fever 102 in the ED. IP fellow
was notified about re-presentation.
Admission Vitals: 90, 91/25, 12, 93% 5L nc. Access: 18G x2.
Received 3L NS IVF.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt is sedated secondary to benadryl (per
daughter) but easily arousable. Daughter says that mental status
improved after IVF and abx administration in the ED with
increased somnolence after IV benadryl administration. Daughter
and pt confirm the above story.

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2163-2-27**] 10:02 AM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-26**], there is little
change in the
minimal right apical pneumothorax. Pigtail catheter remains in
place. Some
areas of increased opacification was seen in the right mid and
lower zones,
consistent most likely with atelectasis.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2163-2-27**] 1:55 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there is no
change in the small apical pneumothorax on the right following
clamping of the chest tube.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2163-2-28**] at 2:38:43 PM      FINAL

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild
mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-11-4**],
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2163-2-28**] 5:32 AM
FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of right-sided pigtail
catheter.
Tiny right apical pneumothorax likely still persists. Bilateral
areas of
atelectasis are again noted to be increased bilaterally and
there maty be
increasing vascular congestion. Otherwise, little change in
comparison to
prior study from yesterday.






Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old female with h/o hypothyoidism, HTN/HL, AAA s/p
repair, known prior stage I lung adenoCA s/p limited resection
with new RLL lung mass along with multiple ground glass
opacities with new RLL lesion showing new squamous cell CA,
admitted with hypotensiona and fever concerning for pna.

The patient was admitted with hypotension, fever, and
leukocytosis.  Her admission labs and chest xray were concerning
for the development of a healthcare-associated pneumonia (she
underwent bronchoscopy a couple of days prior to admission) and
she was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.

Ms. [**Known lastname 3441**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3442**] septic physiology which was initially
responsive to IV fluid resuscitation in the ICU.  Despite
treatment with antibitoics, however, she developed worsening
hypoxia and respiratory distress which required intubation.  She
became intermittently hypotensive while intubated and required
vasopressors.

Her ICU course was complicated by bilateral infiltrates on chest
xray which were ultimately thought to represent ARDS vs.
pulmonary edema.  She also suffered a demand myocardial
infarction in the ICU with resultant apical hypokinesis on
echocardiography.  Cardiology was consulted and the patient was
treated along the ACS pathway.

Given her underlying cancer, which was known to be progressing,
and the severity of her acute illness with refractory
respiratory failure, possible ARDS, and ongoing hypotension,
many family meetings took place with members of the ICU team.
In keeping with the patient's wishes, the [**Known lastname 3441**] family decided to
focus on comfort and withdraw life-supporting.  She was
terminally extubated on [**2163-3-7**].
