Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
sertraline

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
Agitation, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient was unable to participate in interview with me. This
note is based heavily on the information gathered by the ED
physicians and the Neurologist who consulted in the ED.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 62523**] is a 56-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse
with recent admission for presumed Wernicke encephalopathy,
alcohol withdrawal who presented from his skilled nursing/rehab
center for agitation after being discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] two days
ago. At the rehab facility, the patient spent the last 24 hours
in severe agitation that required 4-point restraints and
multiple chemical restraints in order for him to calm down.

According to the Neurologist in the ED, he was disoriented,
tachycardic, agitated, and diaphoretic in the setting of
presumed 3 days abstinence from benzos. Mr. [**Known lastname 62523**] had some
restriction in eye movements but no gaze deviation and no
lateralizing signs at this point. Neurology believes withdrawal
is the most likely etiology. If fevers develop, he may require a
lumbar puncture. such as infection  Metabolic derangements, drug
overdose, hepatic failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding can
also mimic or coexist with withdrawal. In the absence of
complications, symptoms can persist for up to seven days.
Additionally as he does not seem to have full abduction of his
eyes, Neurology recommends continuing on IV thiamine for
presumed Wernicke's. Given that the mammillary bodies are
enriched with dopamine receptors, would avoid Haldol as this may
exacerbate his Wernicke Korsakoff's pathology.

[**2129-9-14**] head CT:
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.

[**2129-9-14**] CXR:
FINDINGS:  A single portable supine chest radiograph was
obtained.  Exam is limited by patient rotation.  Lung volumes
are low.  Pulmonary vessels are engorged.  There is no effusion
or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.

IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and engorged pulmonary vessels

[**2129-9-15**] EKG:
Sinus bradycardia. Non-specific slight ST segment elevation in
the precordial leads and lateral leads. Possible early
repolarization. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2129-9-7**]
bradycardia is new, ST segment elevation is slightly more
pronounced and could be rate related.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcohol
dependence who was recently discharged after detoxifying at [**Hospital1 1535**] but also suffering from
Wernicke-Korsakoff's syndrome, who presented from his nursing
facility with altered mental status.

#. Delirium/altered mental status: Patient had been agitated at
nursing facility. TSH, B12, folate, and lactate all within
normal limits. Ammonia also normal. Patient was been afebrile,
WBC was normal, CXR and UA negative. CT head was negative.
Neurology and Psychiatry consulted.  Psychiatry discovered that
patient was receiving oxazepam at facility. Combined with the
significant (12mg IV) lorazepam he received in Emergency
Department and 5mg IV more on initial evening in ICU,
benzodiazepine intoxication felt to be responsible for much of
altered mental status. Benzos stopped and replaced with Zyprexa
to a maximum dose of 35mg daily with monitoring of QTc (407 on
last day of ICU stay).  Patient continued on folate,
multivitamin, vitamin D and thiamine.  Patient restarted on home
olanzapine 5 mg QAM and 15 mg QPM per psychiatry recs.  EKG was
periodically monitored for prolongation of the QTc. He continued
to be agitated particularly at night and was started on
trazadone 100 mg QHS and mirtazepine 30 mg PO QHS.  He improved
on this regimen.  After originally planning to send the patient
to a dementia unit, eventually his brother made the decision to
take him home with 24 hour supervision at his home.  Vitamin
supplementation was discontinued on discharge as patient is no
longer drinking alcohol.  He will follow up frequently with his
PCP and will also follow up with cognitive neurology.

#. Hyponatremia: Patient presented with hyponatremia.  He may
have been volume down at his nursing facility, esecially if he
has been agitated and unable to take PO. During his last
hospitalization, his sodium was well within normal limits.
Sodium corrected to low normal with maintenance fluids.

# Back pain- Patient has migratory low back pain without any
neurological deficits or signs of infection. This is a chronic
issue for Mr. [**Known lastname 62523**]. He was treated with ibuprofen, tylenol
and lidocaine patch, which helped.

Chronic Issues:
#. Hypertension: Continued home propranolol and lisinopril.

#. Essential tremor: Continued home proprnaolol.

#. Presumed CAD: Continued home aspirin.

#. Presumed BPH: Continued home tamsulosin.

#. Presumed GERD: Continued home omeprazole.

Transitional Issues:
- Olanzapine: maximum dose 30 mg daily in a 24 hour span
- Monitor QTc regularly (goal QTc < 500 ms)Qtc on [**2129-10-4**] 400

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 62523**],

You were admitted to the hospital with confusion and agitation
from your rehabilitation hospital. You were seen by neurology
and psychiatry and your medications were changed.  There was no
infection or new [**Last Name **] problem found.  This may have been due to
a kind of medication called benzodiazepine.  Your agitation and
confusion improved over the course of your hospitalization.  You
also worked with physical therapy and occupational therapy.  You
were treated with tylenol and ibuprofen for your back pain.

We really encourage you to abstain from alcohol.  Any further
drinking will cause your mental status to deteriorate.

Medication changes:
Please take trazadone 100 mg at night
Please take mirtazepine 30 mg at night
Please take acetominophen 325-650mg every 6 hours as needed for
back pain (do not exceed 4 grams per day)
Please take Ibuprofen 600mg every 8 hours as needed for back
pain, must take with food to avoid stomach damage
Please stop taking Thiamine.
Please stop taking Vitamin D.
Please stop taking Folic acid.
