Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
anterior wall STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary Catheterization X2
Intubation/Extubation


History of Present Illness:
83yo with a history DM, HTN, and MI with RCA stenting in [**2127**]
arrived to ED by ambulance after 1 hr of substernal chest pain
that came on while shoveling snow at approximately 11am this
morning.  Upon arrival to the ED he was found to have ST
elevations in V1-V5 with ST depressions in  II, III, AvF and Q
waves in v1-V5 and new RBB.  He was urgently taken to cardiac
cath where he was found to have complete acute occlusion of the
proximal LAD with an completely occluded RCA and 90% occluded
circumflex. After angioplasty flow was recovered in the LAD and
a stent was placed.  During the procedure the patient had
multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia and underwent
electrocardioversion several times and started on amiodarone. He
vomitted and was intubated. He became hypotensive and was
started on dopamine 15mcg/kg.  Post procedure PCWP was 40 mm/Hg
with V waves to 80.  Bedside echo showed an VEF of 20-25% with
3+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 6**] aortic balloon pump was not placed because he has a
tortuous aorta.
During the procedure he received over 600cc of contrast and was
given 40mg of lasix.

ROS: Per wife,  cardiac review of systems is notable for two
weeks of fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and presyncope. No chest
pain before today's acute event. Also no paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, or palpitations.

.
#ECHO on [**2-21**]: LVEF = 20% ; 3+ MR ;
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the anterior wall, septum, distal LV segments
and apex. There is hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF =
20%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen (no
papillary muscle rupture or frank prolapse seen). There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
#Cardiac Catheterization on [**2137-2-21**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
3 vessel CAD. The LMCA had no obstruction. The LAD was flush
occluded
proximallly. The LCX had an 80% mid lesion adn an 80% OM1. The
RCA was
occluded in the mid vessel and filled distally via collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and
right sided
filling pressures, cardiogenic shock with a PCWP of 40 with V
waves to
55.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with a
overlapping
2.5 x 18 and 2.5 x 12 mm minivision stents which were post
dilated with
a 3.0 x 15 mm Quantum balloon. Final angiography revealed no
residual
stenosis, no dissection and TIMI III flow.
5. Acute anterior STEMI, cardiogenic shock and VT requiring
defibrillation/pacing for heart block.

#Cardiac Catheterization on [**3-1**]
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
stent
thrombosis within the previously placed proximal LAD distal BMS.
The
LMCA had no significant disease. The LAD stents were patent with
a
distal filling defect and probable stent underexpansion with
stent
thrombosis. The LCX was unchanged from prior. The RCA was not
engaged.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial
pressures with
an SBP of 120 mm Hg.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
4. Successful balloon angioplasty of the LAD stents with a 2.75
balloon
with no residual stenosis, defect or dissection.

# [**2-28**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND:  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale
and Doppler
examination of the bilateral common femoral, superficial
femoral, and
popliteal veins was performed.  There is a deep venous
thrombosis in the right
superficial femoral vein extending all the way down to the
popliteal vein with
intraluminal clot expanding the vein and absence of flow
consistent with
complete occlusion.  The right common femoral vein is patent.
There is no
evidence of deep venous thrombosis involving the left leg.
IMPRESSION:  DVT on the right extending from the superficial
femoral vein to the popliteal vein.

# [**3-4**] V/Q scan: Low probability

# [**3-4**] CXR:IMPRESSION: Mild CHF with small pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
STEMI and RCA stent in [**2127**], anterior STEMI [**2137-2-21**] with 2
overlapping BMS to proximal LAD, anterior STEMI [**2137-3-1**] with
stent thrombosis, DMII, HTN, and CRI.

# CAD/Ischemia:  Status post STEMI and RCA stent in [**2127**],
anterior STEMI [**2137-2-21**] with 2 overlapping BMS to proximal LAD,
anterior STEMI [**2137-3-1**] with stent thrombosis.  Patient presented
with anterior STEMI with ST elevations V1-V4 and ST depressions
in II III and aVf.  By cardiac angiography he was found to have
completely occluded proximal LAD, 80% occlusion of the Lcx and
complete proximal occlusion of the RCA with distal flow from
collaterals. The LAD lesion was opened by angioplasty and a bare
metal stent was placed.  During the procedure the patient became
hypotensive with episodes of V Tach and V fib requiring multiple
cardioversions.  After emesis he was intubated for airway
protection. He was then transfered to the CCU and started on
[**Month/Day/Year **], plavix, and heparin. On [**2137-3-1**] pt developed chest pain
while at rest and was found to have anterior ST elevations in
V1-V3. He was treated with nitroglycerin, O2, and morphine which
resulted in alleviation of his symptoms. At cardiac
catheterization he was found to have an LAD stent thrombosis
that was opened with balloon angioplasty resulting in improved
flow through the LAD stent.  He remains on Toprol XL 25mg daily,
[**Last Name (LF) 17339**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and Plavix daily.
.
# Pump: At presentation the patient developed cardiogenic shock
and was found to have a PCWP of 40 with VEF 20% by echo with 3+
MR, and septal and anterolateral ventricular akenesis.  An IABP
was not used becasue the patient has a tortutous aorta.  He was
initially started on dopamine. In the first 24 hours post cath
he developed several episodes of sinus bradycardia and
hypotension when attempting to wean down the dopamine that
required atropine boluses on one occasion. He was transitioned
to levophed on [**2-23**]. Metoprolol was started on [**2-24**]. After
maintaining pressure well he taken off levophed on [**2-26**]. On [**3-1**]
he developed dyspnea and appeared fluid overloaded on clinical
exam and has begun on Lasix for diuresis.  On the day of
discharge the lasix dose was increased to 80mg daily.  This can
be titrated based on fluid status and blood pressure parameters.
 ACE-I/ARBs was held due to concerns for renal function; if
renal function recovers to baseline, we would strongly
recommended ACE inhibitor therapy for decreased EF. Will need to
have creatinine and potassium checked in 2 days at rehab
facility. Needs strict intake/output measurement along with
daily weights.
.
# Rhythm: During cardiac catherization patient had ventricular
tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation that required multiple
cardioversions to regain perfusing rhythm. At that time he was
then started on amiodarone drip.  He was transfered to the CCU
in NSR and the amiodarone was discontinued.  On [**2-23**] and then
again on [**2-24**] he developed atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular repsonse in the context of attempted ventilator
weens.  Both episodes were treated with amiodarone and
metoprolol and he returned to NSR. Since [**2-24**] he has been in NSR
on daily metropolol and amiodarone.  He is also on coumadin.
Coumadin dose was held on [**3-25**] for supratherapeutic INR.
Plan is to restart coumadin on [**3-6**], INR on [**3-5**] at the time of
discharge was 3.1, was receiving a dose of 5mg, patient was
being loaded on amiodarone. The dose of amiodarone will be
decreased and it is reasonable to initiate warfarin at 5mg and
check frequent INR level to ensure he is not supratherapeutic
and adjust as necessary.
.
# Respiratory: During cardiac arrest the patient vomitted and
was intubated for airway protection.  He was removed from
mechanical ventilation on [**2-25**]. Since, he has used up to 3L O2
by nasal canula after patient reported subjective dyspnea though
he has maintained 02 saturations above 95%.  After ecoli was
found in a sputum culture he completed a course of
ciprofloxacin. He has had episodes of dyspnea with elvated JVP
and lower extremity edema, and signs of CHF on CXR;  Diuresis
with lasix was begun on [**3-1**].  The dose was uptitrated from 40mg
PO lasix to 80mg PO lasix based on increased pulmonary edema on
CXR.  VQ scan was low probability for pulmonary embolism on
[**3-4**].

# CKD: Cr 1.4-1.8 at baseline. During initial cardiac
catheterization he received  600cc dye load and  had episodes of
hypotension. He arrived to the CCU with a Non AG acidosis of
unclear etiology that resolved over the next several days. His
Cr peaked on [**2-23**] at 4.4 and then declined steadily declined to
2.4 on [**3-4**] despite receiving another 60cc dye load on [**3-1**].  He
never required HD, although renal consult team followed closely.
He will need renal follow up as an outpatient.

# DVT: Despite therapeutic heparin levels, patient developed a
right sided femoral to popliteal DVT discovered on ultrasound on
[**2-28**]. As mentioned above VQ scan was negative. He was maintained
on heparin and then transitioned to coumadin. Because of DVT
despite heparin for ACS on presentation and antiplatelet therapy
peri-MI as well as in-stent thrombosis on adequate antiplatelet
therapy, concern for hypercoagulable state is high and pt should
have full hypercoagulable work up once other issues are stable.
.
# R arm cellulitis: In addition he developed an infiltrated
right forearm venous access site that became ecchymotic and
tender and was presumptive treated with cefelaxin for concern of
a possible cellulitis.
.
# BPH: Restarted on Flomax on day of discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with an ST elevation myocardial
infarction.  This is a blockage in a vessel supplying blood to
the heart. This vessel was opened with a stent.  You suffered
from a clot in the stent following the placement.  You also had
a decrease in the pumping function of your heart and medications
have been added to compensate for this.

Please take your medications as prescribed. The following
changes has been made to your medications:
- Please start taking aspirin 325mg daily for secondary
cardiovascular prevention (to prevent another heart attack)
- Please start taking atorvastatin 80mg daily for your heart and
for your cholesterol
- Please start taking Toprol XL 25mg daily for your heart and
blood pressure (prevents remodelling of the heart)
- Please start taking clopidogrel (Plavix) 75 mg daily to keep
stents open. DO NOT STOP PLAVIX UNTIL INSTRUCTED BY A
CARDIOLOGIST, EVEN IF ANOTHER DOCTOR RECOMMENDS STOPPING IT. YOU
MUST TAKE THIS MEDICINE EVERY DAY TO PREVENT HEART ATTACKS FROM
YOUR STENTS.
- Please start taking Lasix 80mg daily to help keep your fluid
status appropriate.

Your Flomax was restarted the day of your discharge from the
hospital.  You will need to have your blood pressure monitored
with the addition of this medication.

If you develop chest pain, jaw pain, or chest pressure with pain
radiating into arm, or if you for any reason become concerned
about your medical condition please call 911 or present to
nearest ED.
- We also gave you Nitroglycerin tablets to take if you
experience chest pain, please call 911 or your doctor if chest
pain recurs even if it dissapears with nitroglycerine.
**DO NOT STOP TAKING THE ASPIRIN OR PLAVIX UNLESS INSTRUCTED TO
DO SO BY YOUR CARDIOLOGIST EVEN IF ANOTHER DOCTOR TELLS YOU TO**
