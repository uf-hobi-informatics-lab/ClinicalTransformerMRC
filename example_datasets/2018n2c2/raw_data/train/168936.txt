History of Present Illness:
75 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HCV cirrhosis
c/b HCC s/p lobe resection in [**2156**], POD 12 from craniotomy for
SDH now admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for fever, rash, and hypotension.
The patient was noted at rehab to be febrile to 103 today, and
was also complaining of a "total body itchiness" and was noted
both at rehab and by the ED attending to have trunk and arm
erythema.  He was started on keflex yesterday for possible
superficial phlebitis at an old PIV site, and denies any
localizing symptoms including HA, menigismus, cough, shortness
of breath, dysuria, n/v/d.
.
Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] under the
Neurosurgical service from [**Date range (1) 30844**] after a fall with
bilateral SDH, and underwent right craniotomy on [**11-5**], and
ultimately was discharged to rehab on dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis.  In addition, he was started on keflex the day
prior to admission for question of cellulitis on his left
forearm at the location of a prior PIV site.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 99 68 78/60 18 94%RA.  The patient
had a negative CXR and UA, an I+/- CTH that was read as
unchanged from most recent post-operative study, and
Neurosurgery was consulted with low suspicion for CNS infection.
The patient received 10 mg IV dexamethasone, 5 L IVF,
vancomycin, and levofloxacin, and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further management.
.
Currently, the patient is resting comfortably without
complaints. Continues to deny any CP/SOB, f/c/s, n/v/d, abd
pain, HA, palpitations, dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HCV cirrhosis
complicated by HCC s/p lobe resection in [**2156**], who presented on
post-operative day 12 from craniotomy for a subdural hematoma
with fever, rash, and hypotension.
.
#. Hypotension and Fever: There was immediate concern for sepsis
on presentation to the ED, although no apparent source was
isolated and no significant fever was recorded in the hospital
(had 100.4 on admission to the ED). Sepsis workup was negative
including CXR, UA, Urine and Blood cultures. Final blood cutlure
results are still pending. Given recent craniotomy the
neurosurgery service was consulted and was not concerned for CNS
infection. A RUQ ultraound was performed that confirmed a
moderate amount of ascites and patency of the hepatic vessels,
but the abdomen was not tender and the suspicion for SBP was
low. Adrenal insuficiency was ruled out per cosyntropin test.
The patient did receive a dose of Vancomycin and Levofloxacin in
the ED but none were continued in the ICU as the patient
remained afebrile and the ICU team's suspicion for infectious
process was low. The patient recieved a dose of IV steroids in
the ED and subsequently recieved a 3 day course of Prednisone
60mg. Dilantin was considered as a possible etiology for his
presentation, especially given the acute renal failure and
associated morbilliform rash, as a type IV drug reaction,
including DRESS, though no eosinophilia was noted on
differential. Adittionally patient had recently been started on
Keflex so anaphylactic shock due to allergy to cephalosporins is
another possibility. Both dilantin and Keflex were discontinued
and should be avoided in the future.  The patient remained
afebrile and normotensive during his ICU stay and the day after
admission was transferred to the oncology service. He remained
stable on the oncology floor and is now discharged back to rehab
facility.
.
#. Acute Renal Failure: Patient was admitted with a serum
creatinine of 1.2, up from a known baseline of 0.9 to 1 likely
pre-renal failure in the setting of hypotension. His Cr. on
discharge was 0.9. Renal functions and electrolytes should be
followed in the outpatient setting.
.
#. Elevated Liver Enzymes: 2/2o Hepatitis C Cirrhosis and
Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Patient failed Interferon and
Ribavirin in the past. Patient with known multifocal HCC
recurrence re-confirmed per RUQ ultrasound on this admission.
.
# Metabolic Acidosis: initially normochloremic with slightly
elevated AG, then hyperchloremic with normal anion gap. Likely
initially [**1-15**] to tissue hypoperfusion given the elevated lactate
on admission. Lactate was 3.1 on admission and decreased to 1.3.
Also contributed to by renal failure. Bicarbonate trending up on
discharge.
.
# Anemia: at baseline of 30-35. Had initial drop of Hct
secondary to rehydration and resolution of Hemmoconcentration,
Hct back to baseline at discharge.
.
#. Hypertension: Anti-hypertensives were held in the setting of
hypotension. Tamsulosin 0.4 mg was restarted on discharge.
Amlodipine continues to be held on discharge
.
#. Hypothyroid: Patient was continued on Levothyroxine without
event. Of note patient found to have increased palpable right
lower thyroid lobe. Further workup of this finding may be
considered in the out patient setting.
.
# Code status during this admission: Full
