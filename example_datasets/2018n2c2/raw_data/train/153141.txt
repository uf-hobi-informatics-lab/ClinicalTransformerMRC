Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Redo sternotomy/Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with reverse
    saphenous vein grafts to the second branch of the
    posterior left ventricular branch, obtuse marginal
    artery, and left anterior descending artery.


History of Present Illness:
66yoM with significant CAD s/p CABG ([**2125**]), DES to SVG-D1/OM x2
([**2135**], [**2138**]) who presents with chest pain.The patient has a
significant cardiac history with CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-D1/OM,
SVT-PDA) and DES to ostial SVG-D1/OM, proximal SVG-D1/OM, PCI
with DES to ostial SVG-D1/OM and DES to proximal SVG-D1/OM.  He
has been on Plavix 75 mg daily and full dose Aspirin.  However,
on Tuesday, 10 days prior to presentation, the patient underwent
a lithotripsy for kidney stones with placement of a ureteral
stent and foley bag and his Plavix was held.  He is currently 10
days off Plavix with his cardiologist and urologist both aware.
.
The patient reports his current symptoms began this morning when
he developed sudden onset, dull, substernal chest pain while
walking at a leisurely pace at an automobile dealership.  The
pain was associated with diaphoresis, and subsequently developed
nausea while being transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  His symptoms
were noted to be different than his prior anginal symptoms of
epigastric pain.  He presented to a fire station where they gave
him full dose aspirin and transported him to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  The
patient reports he began developing radiating left arm pain and
precordial pain when he reached the ED.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended Heparin gtt, Plavix
load, and Nitro gtt titrated to pain. Cardiac surgery was
consulted for evaluation of coronary artery revascularization.

EKG ([**12-11**]):  NSR, normal axis.  Dynamic ST depressions in
inferior and precordial leads, more pronounced with increasing
HR on seria EKGs in the ED.
.
Cardiac Catheterization ([**12-13**]):
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated native three vessel CAD. The LMCA had no
angiographically-apparent lesions. The LAD was occluded
proximally, and
had a 90% stenosis just distal to the LIMA-LAD touchdown. The
LCX was
occluded in the mid-vessel segment with faint collaterals to the
OMB.
The dominant RCA was occluded in the proximal vessel segment.
2. Selective arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent
LIMA-LAD.
There was 90% stenosis in the native LAD just distal to the
LIMA-LAD
anastamosis.
3. Selective venous conduit angiography revealed a totally
occluded
SVG-D1/OM1 graft at the proximal segment of ostial stent. The
SVG-PDA
graft was patent to the RCA, but had a 90% retrograde stenosis
to the
PLSA/PLB.
4. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressures with a measured central aortic pressure of 106/64/79.
5. Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native three vessel CAD.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD graft with progression of native distal LAD
disease.
3. Totally occluded SVG-D1-OMB graft.
4. Patent SVG-PDA graft with progression of disease in the
ostium of the
PDA that fills retrograde into the PLSA and posterolateral
branches.
5. Consideration of PCI vs. redo CABG.

Chest CT ([**12-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Post-CABG changes and scattered areas of calcified
atherosclerotic disease in the aortic arch and aortic
valve/annulus but none in the ascending aorta.
2. Subtle ground-glass opacities in the right upper and right
lower lobes,
possibly representing areas of aspiration.
3. A 3-mm right lower lobe nodule; given the patient's history,
a one-year
followup CT is recommended to document stability.

CXR: [**2140-12-24**]: PA and lateral chest compared to [**12-21**]
through 29:
The already improved post-operative widening of the
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. Moderate right pleural effusion and
moderately severe right basal atelectasis are unchanged, but
previous left lower lobe
atelectasis and left pleural effusion are improved. There is no
pulmonary
edema or pneumothorax

Brief Hospital Course:
66yoM with significant CAD s/p CABG ([**2125**]), DES to SVG-D1/OM x2
([**2135**], [**2138**]) who presents with chest pain and dynamic EKG
changes, found to have SVG graft, PDA, LAD stenosis needing
intervention.

# Chest Pain/CORONARIES:  Patient with CABG and DES to SVG-D1/OM
x2 most recently in [**2138**] now presenting with chest pain and
dynamic EKG changes in the inferior and precordial leads.  The
patient's symptoms occurred subsequent to discontinuing Plavix
10 days ago for a lithotripsy.  Initial set of CE's were
negative but subsequent up-trended with CK peak 691 and MB peak
77.  He was on a Heparin gtt and was plavix loaded, and his
chest pain was controlled on a Nitro gtt prior to cardiac
catheterization.  Integrillin gtt and Morphine IV prn were
started prior to catheterization for recurrent chest pain
refractory to up-titration of Nitro gtt.  Cardiac
catheterization [**12-13**] showed completely occluded SVG-D1/OM, 90%
stenosis of SVG-PDA, known 90% LAD stenosis just distal to
touchdown.  He was recommended for CABG-redo and was continued
on Heparin gtt and Integrillin gtt post-cath with the plan of
continuing through until CABG-redo.  Plavix was discontinued at
that time.  The patient had an acute drop in his platelets
(described below) and Integrillin gtt was discontinued.  Shortly
thereafter, he had a presyncopal episode on [**12-16**] during which
he stood up, became pale, lightheaded, and developed mild left
sided chest pain.  Vitals were stable but EKG showed new ST
depressions in two leads, CE's negative.  He was transfused 1
unit PRBC for anemia (had previously refused transfusion) with
resolution of symptoms but persistent ST depressions on EKG.
Heparin gtt was discontinued but 5-H risk score for HIT was low
and HIT Ab was negative.  The patient remained chest pain free
until CABG-redo on Tue.

#. Thrombocytopenia:  Patient developed severe
thrombocytopenia,secondary to Integrillin.  Although the
patient's thrombocytopenia occurred later than expected for
integrillin-induced thrombocytopenia, the precipitous drop and
extended period of time he was on integrillin both support this
as the most likely etiology. Plt dropped from 150->10 in 24 hrs.
Integrillin drip was stopped at 2pm on [**12-15**] and he has been
given a total of 3 units of platelets.  HIT Antibody was also
sent which was negative.  5H HIT Risk Score was also low, making
it less likely to be HIT.  However, Heparin gtt was discontinued
in the setting of profound thrombocytopenia given the patient
has been chest pain free.  In the setting of thrombocytopenia,
he developed significant bleeding from around his foley catheter
and recent lithotrypsy procedure, which was switched to a 3-way
foley on CBI.  His hct has down-trended and he received a total
of 1 unit PRBC on [**12-16**].  He was also given several platelet
transfusions for the thrombocytopenia.  The anticipated platelet
recovery with integrillin-induced thrombocytopenia is 4 hours to
5 days, and the patient's platelets slowly up-trended and by
[**12-19**] he was in the 100s.

# Urine analysis:  Patient with large blood, significant
leukocytes, protein on UA likely [**1-26**] recent lithotripsy and
ureteral stent placement.  Foley leg bag in place, dark red
urine in setting of Plavix, Heparin gtt, ASA 325.  Urology
followed pt inhouse. Patient had significant bleeding from
around the foley and it was replaced with a 3-way foley catheter
on CBI.  Urology planned to remove ureteral stent and foley and
following CABG.  Repeat UA suspicious for UTI, started Cipro
[**12-15**].  Repeat UA today in setting of culture showing "probable"
enterococcus previously in the setting of significant blood in
urine and improved urine currently.  Repeat UA and UCx sent
after bleeding hematuria improved. The patient was treated with
Cipro 250 mg x7 days for complicated cysistits in male with
recent urologic procedure. (d1=[**12-15**])

On [**12-15**] Mr.[**Known lastname 1007**] was taken to the operating room and underwent
Redo sternotomy/ Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 (reverse
saphenous vein grafts to the second branch of the posterior left
ventricular branch, obtuse marginal artery, and left anterior
descending artery)with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. CROSSCLAMP TIME:65 minutes.PUMP
TIME:  99 minutes. He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated. He awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Pressors were weaned
off. All lines and drains were discontinued per protocol.
Beta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin and diuresis initiated. POD#1 he
transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility. As discussed with Urology, the foley catheter was
discontinued per csurg protocol. The following morning he failed
to void and the foley was reinserted. A second void trial was
done on POD#4 and he voided. The remainder of his postoperative
course was essentially uneventful. He continued to progress and
on POD5 he was cleared for discharge to home with VNA. All
follow up appointments were advised.
