Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea, labored breathing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
endocardial biopsy


History of Present Illness:
35yF with multiple medical problems (including SLE, restrictive
lung disease, global cardiomyopathy with severely depressed
systolic function, nephrotic syndrome), with recent admission
[**Date range (1) 68983**] for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, re-admitted with
shortness of breath, tachycardia, and persistent nausea.

Her symptoms began in [**Month (only) **] (after a recent
hospitalization), when she developed diarrhea (which she relates
to her metoprolol). The diarrhea (multiple times daily,
non-bloody, brown in color) initially improved but then worsened
again. She then developed nausea, vomiting, and dry heaves,
without abdominal pain, and was admitted on [**10-10**]. She also
reported worsening shortness of breath, 3 pillow orthopnea, and
episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She was felt to be
intravascularly dry, so she was given IV fluids. She had a
thorough workup for causes of her diarrhea (infectious,
structural, medication related etc.) and was scheduled for GI
follow up on [**10-16**]. During the admission, an echocardiogram was
performed, demonstrating worsening systolic function (EF
15-20%), but she was felt to be intravascularly dry, so her
Lasix was held. Given the patient's concern that her diarrhea
started at the same time as metoprolol (75mg daily), this
medication was also stopped (and switched to carvedilol 3.125mg
[**Hospital1 **]). She was to have close follow up with her cardiologist. She
had acute on chronic renal failure which returned to close to
baseline (1.5) with IV fluids; she had a renal biopsy during
that admission, the results of which are still pending. Her
Imuran was initially held during the last hospitalization but
was restarted after a conversation with her [**Hospital1 112**] rheumatologist.
During that hospitalization, her nausea was not fully explained,
but there was a possibility that restarting her Imuran may have
contributed.

Her presentation today is similar. She has nausea and dry heaves
(non-bloody, non-bilious), along with worsening shortness of
breath/PND/orthopnea. Her husband (who follows her vitals
closely) has noted increased blood pressures and heart rates
since she was discharged from the hospital. Given her worsened
nausea and tachycardia to the 120's, he brought her to the
hospital. She denies any history of blood clot (but had IUFD at
21wks recently).

In the ED, triage vitals were T97.6F, HR 124, BP 126/109, RR 18,
Sat 100%. She was given 4mg IV ondansteron x 2, in addition to
ceftriaxone and azithromycin given an equivocal chest x-ray. She
was transferred to the floor for further evaluation. Her
respiratory rate was noted to be as high as 33.

On review of systems, she reports nausea and vomiting, as well
as shortness for breath and orthopnea as above. Diarrhea is
unchanged. She denies fevers, chills, chest pain (but perhaps
some chest "heaviness"), palpitations, pleuritic chest pain,
cough, weakness, numbness, tingling, abdominal pain,
constipation, hematemesis, hematochezia, urinary symptoms.

Past Medical History:
- SLE: diagnosed in [**2168**], manifested by kidney disease
(membranous nephropathy by report of biopsy), facial rash,
Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, and pleuritis
- Gastritis
- Restrictive lung disease: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], noted to
be moderate to severe on PFTs completed 5/[**2179**].
- History of pancytopenia associated with varicella zoster
infection
- History of persistent thrombocytopenia
- Baseline proteinuria (Cr 0.8-0.9 pre-pregnancy)
- Intrauterine fetal demise [**7-/2180**] (at gestational age ~21wks)
- Right- and left-sided cardiomyopathy (EF estimated 15-20% in
[**9-/2180**])


Social History:

CXR [**10-15**] PA/Lat (prelim): Retrocardiac opacification which may
represent atelectasis vs. pneumonia; bibasilar effusions and
increased hilar infiltrates suggestive of volume overload;
stable moderate cardiomegaly.

ECG [**10-15**]: Sinus tachycardia. Leftward axis, normal intervals.
TWF in I, II, V5-V6 (interpreted as pseudonormalization in ED,
but unimpressive).

[**Month/Year (2) **] [**10-11**]: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure
is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. RV with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-7-24**], the
LV cavity size has increased and the LVEF is slightly lower
(LVEF OVERestimated on prior study). RV dysfunction is now more
prominent.
.
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 33 %.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal
free wall systolic function. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

.
[**Year (4 digits) **] [**2180-11-6**]
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate to
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate thickening of the
mitral valve chordae. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**Month/Day/Year **] [**2180-11-9**]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-11-6**],
left ventricular cavity size is smaller, global systolic
function is improved (quantitative biplane LVEF 30% on review of
prior study), and the severity of mitral regurgitation and
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are reduced.


Brief Hospital Course:
35yF with multiple medical problems (including SLE, restrictive
lung disease, global cardiomyopathy with severely depressed
systolic function, nephrotic syndrome), with recent admission
[**Date range (1) 68983**] for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, admitted with
shortness of breath, tachycardia, and persistent nausea.
.
#) Cardiomyopathy: Pt was initially admitted to the hospitalist
service but transferred for cath and endocardial biopsy in the
setting of worsening EF.  Her cardiomyopathy was thought to be
due to lupus.  Peripartum cardiomyopathy was also considered
however given the timing of onset and biopsy showing immune
complexes seen on endocardial biopsy, lupus cardiomyopathy was
thought to be more likely.  She was treated with steroids,
cytoxan, plasmaphoresis, IVIG and supportive care, and improved
from an EF of 15 to 33%.  It is unclear which therapy led to
improvement.  She did require temporary CCU transfer for
milrinone given worsening EF, however was weaned after a few
days and transferred back to the floor in stable condition.  Her
mitral regurgitation and hypertension also contributed to her
poor forward flow, and htn improved with diuresis, hydralazine,
lisinopril and amlodipine.
.
#) sCHF, volume overload: On admission, pt was clearly
tachypneic but satting well on room air. Reported 3 pillow
orthopnea and paroxysmal noctural dyspnea, in the setting of
recent d/c Lasix and IVF resuscitation, LE edema also suggested
fluid overload.  BNP extremely elevated at 65,187.  She also had
non-specific sxs concerning for HF including throat tightness
and GI sxs.  Her sxs improved with diuresis and symptomatic
management and she was discharged on oral torsemide.  She was
also treated with BP control and bblocker therapy.  Given her
SOB and LE edema R>L, a LE US was performed and showed no LE
clot, therefore PE was thought to be unlikely.
.
#) SLE. Pt diagnosed in [**2168**], manifested by kidney disease
previously membranous nephropathy, facial rash, Sjogren's
syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, and pleuritis.  Previously
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 68981**] at B&W, however has requested to transfer
her care to [**Hospital1 18**] after this admission.  Initially contined on
Plaquenil and Imuran, as well as prednisone.  Plaquenil dc'd per
rheumatology recs.  Cardiomyopathy and renal failure on current
admission were felt to be manifestation of underlying lupus.
Rheumatology was consulted and recommended aggressive therapy
with steriods, cytoxan and plasmapheresis.  Received solumedrol
1g daily x 3 followed by solumedrol 30mg IV q12hrs, which was
uptitrated to 60 q 12 hrs and subseuquently tapered and she was
ultimately discharged on prednisone 60mg orally daily.  She was
also placed on atovaquone PCP prophylaxis in the setting of
immunosuppression.  She recieved 1 dose of cytoxan 750mg on [**10-20**]
with mesna, cell counts with nadir on [**11-5**].  Prior to cytoxan,
she received 7.5mg Lupron for ovarian protection with plans to
pursue egg harvesting for fertility as an outpatient.  Received
5 cycles of plasmapheresis.  3 doses of IVIG was also
administered given that pts HF continued to worsen during the
hospital stay.  Additional plasmaphoreis was considered but held
due to her continued improvement.
.
#) Nausea/diarrhea. Initially thought secondary to restarting
Imuran, however pt and husband attributed to bblocker therapy.
Most likely due to gut edema in the setting of right HF.  GI was
consulted and agreed however recommended ruling out infectious
etiology given her immunosuppression; w/u was negative. She
improved with symptomatic tx and treatment of her HH.
.
#) thrombocytopenia: Pt bleeding from HD site [**10-21**], improved
with Cryo, Platelets, and Surgicel. Patient developed
thrombocytopenia with nadir of 68, likely multifactorial related
to dilution, imunnosupression, and possibly pheresis.  Heme
consulted and recommended removing ASA, NSAIDs, all heparin
products, f/u LFTs, fibrinogen.  Platelet drop was too quick to
be related to Cytoxan and likelihood of developping 4T score is
3. HIT ab negative. Fibrinogen nomralized. Thrombocytopenia
quickly improved, however then fluctuated in the setting of
cytoxan use.  IgG and IgM ACA negative, so unlikely to have
prothrombotic state.
.
#) Acute on chronic RF: Pt with h/o SLE Nephritis. Pt previously
with membranous nephropathy on prior biopsy.  She had repeat
biopsy showing type 3,4,5 lupus nephritis.  Worsening renal
failure with creatinine increased to 3.7 up from 1.4 on
admission.  Urine lytes indicative of prerenal ischemia (FeUrea
< 0.02%) +/- evolving ATN  likely from poor cardiac output/
cardiorenal syndrome.  renal U/S show's no obstruction.   While
her renal function showed some initial worsening with diuresis,
diuresis was continued due to continued volume overload, and
creatinine remained stable.
.
# HTN: BPs improved with uptitration of hydralazine and addition
of lisinopril.  Pt concerned that hydralazine may be causing
joint pain.  Given this and her improved renal function,
lisinopril was uptitrated and hydralazine discontinued.  Blood
pressures stable
.
# Anemia:  Likely due to acute renal disease, cytoxan therapy.
Pt was given one unit of PRBCs while in patient and started on
epo with good improvement in her crit.
.
# Joint pain: ? medication side effect (IVIG, hydralazine) vs
lupus flare, however pt has never had joint pain with lupus
flares in the past.  Hydralazine was discontinued, symptomatic
relief with tylenol, PT.
