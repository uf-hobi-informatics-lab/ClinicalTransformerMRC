Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, slurred speech, increased frequency of urination

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Foley catheter placed


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 64 y/o African American gentleman who has a past medical
history significant for DMII (most recent HbA1c:11.8 on
[**2105-3-28**]), HTN, and BPH who initially presented with
dysarthria, weakness and change in bladder habits. Pt was in his
normal state of health until about a week ago when he began to
notice an increase in the number of times he had to urinate.
Although he has nocturia at baseline (usually wakes 3-4 times
per week to use the bathroom at night), he began to use the
bathroom during the day with increasing frequency, every 15-20
minutes. He found that he was urinating only a very small
amount, "several drops" each time and felt like he had not
completely emptied his bladder.
Then, on [**2105-7-14**], the patient woke up and felt generally weak.
He noticed his speech was slurred and his legs felt unsteady
when getting up from bed. The weakness came on all of a sudden
and he felt a cramping fatigue worst in his calves. He had no
trouble understanding others or finding words, but noticed his
pronunciation of words was impaired. In addition, he also felt
intermittently very cold and then very hot. When his partner
arrived home, she too immediately noticed the changes in his
speech and brought him to the ED at [**Hospital3 **].

At [**Hospital1 **] initial VS were: 98.2 72 156/82 14 98% on RA. He was
observed to have altered mental status, raising suspicion for
possible TIA or stroke. Head CT was normal. Lab work was notable
for Cr 10.4, K 8.4. He received 2 grams Ca-gluconate, 10 units
of insulin and D50, sodium bicarbonate, and 15 mg PO Kayakelate.
He was found to be in acute renal failure with hyperkalemia,
with EKG changes notable for peaked T waves. Suspecting the need
for emergent dialysis he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Pt arrived to the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**] where he was alert and oriented
x3 At [**Hospital1 18**], he presented with SBPS to 190.  Electrolyte
abnormalities not improved.  EKG with persistently peaked t
waves.  He was transfered to the MICU and treated medically
without need for hemodialysis.  Foley was placed with over 500cc
relieved.  DRE showed prostate enlargement, symmetric in nature.
 In the MICU serial ekg's normalized.  He proceeded to have
brisk urine output.  Potassium normalized and Cr trending
downward.

He has had chronic knee pain for which he takes acetaminophen;
he also takes a nightly ibuprofen-containing sleep aid for
insomnia.


Past Medical History:
-Hyperlipidemia
-Hypertension: Stress ECHO ([**2105-7-1**]) with normal LV wall
[**Last Name (LF) 93024**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]=60%, no LVH, normal stress response
-Non-insulin dependent DM II: HbA1c=11.8 ([**2105-3-28**])


Social History:
Pt is a bus driver for children with special needs. He lives
alone, but has a partner with whom he is very close. He has
three grown children and three grandchildren. He denies a
history of tobacco or cigarette use. He drinks socially, [**3-22**]
times per week; 6 shots of vodka/week. He denies any history of
illicit drug use.

Imaging Studies
Renal Ultrasound ([**2105-7-15**])
1. No hydronephrosis.  Bilateral tiny simple renal cysts noted.
2. Incidentally noted, the liver is diffusely echogenic,
consistent with fatty infiltration.  Other forms of liver
disease and more advanced liver disease including significant
hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 y/o African American male with a PMH of DMII and HTN who
presented with generalized weakness, altered mental status,
slurred speech and increased frequency of small amounts of
urination.  He was found to be in acute renal failure at an OSH
and transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible hemodialysis.  He was
stabilized medically in the ICU until [**7-16**] when his care was
transitioned to the general medicine service.

**ACUTE ISSUES**
# Acute Renal Failure: He presented in acute renal failure with
creatinine of 10.4 (baseline 0.9), hyperkalemia, and EKG
changes.   His ARF was largely attributed to obstruction as he
was retaining over 500cc urine and found to have large symmetric
prostate on DRE.  However, no hydronephrosis seen on ultrasound.
 Additionally, he was also on a number of potentially
nephrotoxigenic medications causing ATN, including lisinopril,
NSAIDs, and potassium citrate. He was initially medically
managed in the ICU IVF, lasix, bicarb with good effect.  Renal
function gradually improved over several days following catheter
placement, fluid support, and discontinuation of nephrotoxigenic
drugs.  He was discharged with a Cr of 5.7, and not restarted on
his nephrotoxic meds.  He will be followed by renal as an
outpatient.  Furthermore, he was started on Tamsulosin for his
BPH.  His foley remained in place to allow [**5-26**] day bladder rest
before urology will try voiding trial as an outpatient in the
next few days.

#Hyperkalemia: He was found to have an elevated K 8 with
associated peaked T waves. Potassium levels dropped with
administration of kayexalate, insulin, and bicarbonate. Serial
EKGS also showed resolution of peaked T waves.

#DM II: Prior to this admission, he was only taking oral
hypoglycemics.  However, these were discontinued in light of his
ARF.  His blood sugars were managed on sliding scale insulin.
Since he required Humalog 5-7 units for the last 3 days of
hospitalization, he was sent home on Lantus 2units QHS with
lispro sliding scale coverage.  He will be followed by his PCP
in the next 2-3 days for follow-up  of this new diabetes
regimen.  He was also provided with an educational counseling
session regarding home insulin.  His oral hypoglycemics were
held, with the goal of transitioning back to agents after renal
approval and Cr normalization.

#BPH:  As above, his BPH contributed to urinary obstruction and
ARF.  DRE revealed symmetric enlargement of prostate.  Previous
biopsy was benign.  Was started on Tamsulosin this admission.
Urology will follow in clinic for void trial.

**CHRONIC ISSUES**
# Hypertension: He was found to be hypertensive to SBP 180s
during the admission as his ACE-I was held in light of his ARF.
After transfer to the floor, he was continued on his Amlodipine
5mg and Metoprolol succinate 100 daily.  Quinapril discontinued
indefinitely. Tamsulosin added for BPH.

# Hyperlipidemia: Stable, continued his home statin.

**TRANSITIONAL ISSUES**
-Urology outpatient follow up: The patient will be called by
urology for an appointment this week.  Until then, foley will
remain in place and he will be visited by VNA for foley-related
care.
-Renal outpatient follow up to readdress kidney function and
possibility of restoring prior home meds: quinapril, metformin,
glipizide
-PCP follow up in the next couple days to follow up glucose
control on newly started insulin regimen and antihypertensive
regimen, and side effects to newly started Tamsulosin. Also
should repeat chem 7 to follow up K and Cr.
-Following meds should not be restarted until clearance from
renal:  quinipril, metformin, glipizide, NSAIDS, KCL

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Dr. [**Known lastname 174**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were hospitalized
at [**Hospital1 69**]. You were hospitalized
because of changes in mental status, decreased urine output,
generalized weakness, and decreased functioning of your kidney.
Your kidney injury was most likely caused by an obstruction of
the bladder as a result of your large prostate. You were treated
with IV fluid resuscitation, that you tolerated well. A foley
catheter was also placed to bypass the bladder obstruction
caused by the enlarged prostate. The catheter will remain in
place until you follow up with the urology doctors. You will
receive more information about the details of this appointment
in the next couple of days. At the time of the appointment they
will provide you with further instructions concerning the
catheter and management of your large prostate. You were also
started on Tamsulosin, a medication that will help to reduce the
size of your prostate. Overall, your kidney function improved
greatly with these interventions.

Over the next several weeks it is very important that you stay
well hydrated and drink lots of fluids. If you notice an
increase in pain around the catheter, pain with urination,
change in urine color, or fever please contact your PCP or
return to the Emergency Room.

We have arranged several follow-up appointments for you
regarding your kidney function and enlarged prostate. These are
listed below.

We have made changes to your medications which are described
below.
