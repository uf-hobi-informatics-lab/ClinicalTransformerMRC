GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endoscopy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year old man with PMH of colostomy 20 years ago who
presents with bleeding per rectum. He reports being in his
normal state of health until 4 days ago, when he noticed slight
stomach ache, then had maroon bowel movements, [**4-13**] daily. He
reports that this continued until the morning of presentation,
when he had a syncopal episode and went to the ER on [**Location (un) 7453**] by EMS. He was found to have a HCT of 19, and was given
3 units prbc. An abdominal CT was performed with showed possible
gastric mass but was limited by lack of contrast. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] by [**Location (un) **].
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], his initial hct was 26. He was tachycardic to 117 but
blood pressure was 137/56. He had a bowel movement reported to
be "maroon" with some black parts, but denies black bowel
movments otherwise. He was admitted to the ICU for further
management and endoscopy.
.
ROS: He denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis,
fever, chills, lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath,
or other concerns.


Past Medical History:
diverting colostomy [**2182**] for 12 months, then reversed, for
"stomach leak"

Social History:
Lives at home. Drinks 2-3 drinks per night. Smokes 1 ppd.

Family History:
 no bowel problems


Physical Exam:
V: Tc 97.6 P108 BP 109/59 R20 100% RA
Gen: slightly disheveled, no distress
HEENT: right pupil with cataract, left none. Reactive to light.
OP clear. MM dry
Resp: CTA bilaterally
CV: tachycardic, nl s1s2 no mGR
Abd: soft NTND +BS
Ext: no edema


Pertinent Results:
EKG: sinus tachy at 118 no Q waves no ST/t wave changes.
.
Imaging: CXR: AP bedside chest shows normal heart and aorta
without vascular congestion, consolidations, or effusions.
Lungs are well inflated with relative prominence central
pulmonary vessels suggesting possible emphysema/cor pulmonale.
No comparison exams on PACS.

.
CT Chest:
1. No duodenal or pancreatic mass identified. Inflammatory
changes between the pancreatic head and duodenum as well as
enhancement and dilatation of the common bile duct are likely
secondary inflammatory changes related to recently seen duodenal
bulb ulcer (see Careweb for EGD findings from [**2200-5-22**]).
2. Four-mm nodule in the right upper lobe abutting the major
fissure. Conservative followup in one year is recommended to
ensure stability.
3. Multiple bilateral renal hypodensities are too small to
characterize, but likely cysts.
4. Tiny bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
69M with remote history of colectomy, reversed, presented with
syncope and GI bleed
.
1) GI bleed - Still unclear whether upper or lower. although
suspect upper source. Intially, he was NPO with serial HCTs. He
also received a PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Endoscopy revealed small hiatal hernia,
erosion in the antrum compatible with non-steroidal induced
gastritis, ulcer in the posterior bulb (given thermal therapy).
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum. He was
transfused 3 units PRBCs and remained hemodynamically stable.  H
pylori sent and pending at time of discharge; patient started on
empiric therapy that can be discontinued if serology returns
negative.  Counseled to stop alcohol as well.
.
2) Syncope - most likley syncope in setting of GI bleed. 1 set
CE's negative. EKG - sinus tach. Tele x 24 hours showed no
events.
.
3) Smoking - Given nicotine patch while in hospital.  Counseled
on need to stop smoking.  Lung nodule incidentally seen on CT
scan chest; should get repeat CT scan in next 6 months-year to
follow for stability.
