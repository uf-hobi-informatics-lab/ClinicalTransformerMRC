EVALUATION:
The examination was performed while the patient was seated
upright in the bed on VICU 11.
Cognition, language, speech, voice: Awake, alert, but slow to
respond, limited verbal output, appearing fatigued. He did
follow
one step commands, though inconsistently, with a delay and with
visual cues/modeling.  Pt's speech was intelligible and fluent,
but responses were very limited. Vocal quality was breathy,
though the pt could generate adequate voicing with effort.

Teeth: Edentulous
Secretions: Mild amount of thick, clear, sputum was stranding
from the hard palate to the tongue. This was removed with the
Yankauer catheter.

ORAL MOTOR EXAM:
WFL for labial and lingual symmetry and ROM. However, both
labial/buccal tone and tongue strength were diminished. Palatal
elevation was symmetrical. Gag was absent.

SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:
PO swallowing assessment was completed at bedside with ice
chips,
thin liquids (tsp, cup), purees ( tsp x2), and nectar thick
liquid (tsp, cup). Oral transit was minimally slowed though no
residue was noted. Pt had a difficult time initiating taking any
po's, so feeding was required however he would not open his
mouth
sufficiently to actually allow adequate boluses into his mouth.
Laryngeal elevation appeared adequate to palpation, though he
swallowed multiple times per bolus. He did c/o sensation of
puree
sticking in his throat. Overt coughing was noted with thin
liquids and pt confirmed sensation of aspiration. No further
po's
could be assessed as pt refused any more boluses.

SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
Pt is demonstrating overt signs of aspiration with thin liquids,
but more significantly is refusing all po's, despite maximal
encouragement. As such, beyond thin liquids the examination was
limited by the pt's fatigue, delayed response time and refusal.
Notes from discharge facility indicate poor po intake has been
an
issue, but the pt was on a full po diet so it appears that he
was
able to advance off of tube feedings. Unclear whether this
decline is related to post op somnolence or possible
toxic-metabolic issues noted per neurology. However, at this
time, I would recommend the pt remain NPO with enteral nutrition
and medications via the PEG. We will plan to re-evaluate pt
later
this week, either [**2199-5-8**] or [**2199-5-9**].

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Remain NPO with enteral nutrition and medications via the
PEG.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-5-4**] 9:13 PM

Interpretation: There are several areas of hyperintensity on the
diffusion weighted images. These are located in the right
frontal and left occipital lobes with questionable involvement
of the left frontal lobe. These areas are hyperintense on FLAIR,
raising the possibility that they may represent T2 shine
through. However, these diffusion findings are new since the
prior MR examination. Therefore, these likely reflect relatively
new ischemia, although they may not be truly acute. There is no
evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, or mass effect. The
vessels appear unchanged, with a large right A1, and no
detectable left A1 branch of the anterior cerebral artery.

Impression: Several areas of diffusion abnormality suggesting
recent infarction. No evidence of hemorrhage.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2199-5-4**] 2:36 PM

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or
shift of normally midline structures. Chronic right frontal and
parietal lobe infarctions are again noted. Marked
periventricular white matter hypodensity is again seen most
consistent with chronic microvascular infarctions. The
ventricles are prominent and similar in size and symmetry.

The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage. Stable prominent
ventricles.

NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree with the above
interpretation. However, I am concerned that the CTA may suggest
an arteriovenous malformation. There were numerous prominent
vessels, arterial and venous, and no explanation for the
hemorrhage. I discussed this concern with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71522**] at 9:25
pm on [**2199-5-4**].

Brief Hospital Course:
[**5-1**], Pt admitted had a Infrarenal tube graft repair of
abdominal aortic aneurysm via retroperitoneal approach.

Tolerated the procedure well. Had epidural placed for pain
control .L renal cross
clamp time 25 minutes. Argatroban was administered
intra-operatively

Prolong intubation in SICU / requiring pressure support /
metabolic acidosis

On [**5-2**], there was a period of hypotension to 90s/50s requiring
pressor support, but this was transient.

Pt was extubated on [**5-3**].

Pain is currently being managed with Dilaudid PCA and
Bupivacaine epidural. The last morphine dose was at 4:50pm on
[**5-2**]. Epidural DC by pain service

Pt has been somewhat difficult to arouse with limited speech
output and eye rolling during morning rounds [**5-4**], prompting
consult for seizure evaluation from Neurology

CT scan / MRI done - no acute process. Possible AVM. To be
followed as an outpt. Medications adjusted.

Final neurological - toxic-metabolic encephalopathy related to
post-surgical state and sedative medications (Dilaudid) being
used for pain control

Pt received fundaperinox from transition to coumadin for Afib.
Hx of HIT pos. When INR at goal, Fundaperinox was DC'd.

Pt with difficulty swallowing / G tube / pt on TF. Speech and
swallow consult obtained:

BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION:

HISTORY: Thank you for referring this 78 year old male admitted
from [**Hospital1 1501**] on [**2199-5-1**] for AAA repair. AAA was diagnosed when pt
was
admitted [**12-12**] s/p right parietal subacute infarction as well as
right intraventricular hemorrhage. Post op, neurology was
consulted as the pt was somnolent with decreased speech output.
Neurology consult reported that the pt may have toxic-metabolic
encephalopathy related to post-surgical state and sedative
medications being used for pain control. PMH includes:
s/p right parietal subacute infarction and right
intraventricular
hemorrhage,  Seizure disorder, Abdominal aortic aneurysm, Atrial
fibrillation, Hypertension, COPD, CHF, Pulmonary
hypertension,Benign prostatic hypertrophy, T2 compression
fracture found [**2199-1-7**], s/p MRSA bacteremia [**1-13**], s/p
heparin induced thrombocytopenia, s/p cholecystectomy [**1-12**],(+)
UTI.

We were consulted this admission to evaluate whether pt was able
to swallow safely. We evaluated the pt multiple times last
admission with the last examination being a video swallow study
completed on [**2199-2-7**]. That study revealed a mild-moderate
oropharyngeal dysphagia that worsened over time.  After fatigue,
he demonstrated reduced A-P tongue movement, moderate oral
cavity
residue, moderately reduced hyolaryngeal excursion and laryngeal
valve closure, moderate vallecular residue and mild pyriform
sinus residue.  Pt was observed to penetrate both thin and
nectar
thick liquids with eventual aspiration of residue of thin
liquids.

Because pt's oral and pharyngeal muscles fatigued so quickly, he
was at risk to aspirate any texture of solid or liquid over the
course of an entire meal.  As such, we recommended that  the pt
remain primarily NPO at this time with nutrition, hydration, and
medication via PEG.

Per discharge summary from rehab facility, the pt participated
in
speech therapy, had a repeat video swallow study and progressed
to a ground solid, thin liquid po diet while at rehab. However,
his po intake remained poor despite stopping tube feedings and
starting the pt on Megace. However, notes from rehab facility
and
extended care facility indicate the pt was solely on a po diet,
not on tube feedings prior to admission here for AAA repair.
