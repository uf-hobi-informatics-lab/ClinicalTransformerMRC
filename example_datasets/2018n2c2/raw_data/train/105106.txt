Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2071**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue for one week. Transferred to CCU with hypoxic distress
in context of AF with RVR, developed PNA and transferred to MICU
with stabilized AF.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70654**] is a 75M with a history of coronary artery disease
s/p CABG x3 ([**University/College **] Presbyterian NY, [**2145**]), PTCA x2 stents
(DES: proximal LAD and SVG to PDA, [**2156**]) as well as
assymptomatic PAF on coumadin who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2159-4-21**]
with fatigue for the last 5 days. He did not endorse shortness
of breath or chest pain, only generalized fatigue. Other ROS
were negative and notable for the absence of fevers, chills,
productive cough, sick contacts, recent travel or other
complaints.

In the ED, initial vitals: 97.8 65 132/78 16 97. CXR showed a
small new right pleural effusion. EKG showed atrial fibrillation
at a rate of 114, and ST depression II, III, AVf, V4-V6. He was
given Aspirin and placed on Oxygen. Cardiac biomarkers were
negative x 3. He was loaded with dofetilide for chemical
cardioversion of his a fib and went into NSR after the first
dose. The following morning he developed worsening dyspnea and
was found to be hypoxic with O2 sats in the 70s on RA. He
triggerred for hypoxia and was found to have expiratory wheezes
and crackles at the base. Chest x-ray showed severe scoliosis
and opacities within both lower lobes. VBG showed pH 7.42, pO2
53, pCo2 30. He was placed on a non-rebreather with O2 sats that
returned to 92%. The team felt that his symptoms were either CHF
versus pneumonia, with CHF more likely because he did not have a
white count or fever at the time. He was diuresed with 20 mg IV
lasix x 3 and had 2 L of urine output. He remained on the
non-rebreather throughout the afternoon despite the diuresis. He
was given nebulizers and ordered doxycycline and augmentin for
possible community acquired pneumonia (although he did not
receive antibiotics). At 6:30 pm nightfloat came to evaluate the
patient and was concerned. An ABG showed pH 7.42 pO2 66 and pCO2
54. Vanc and cefipime were started and the CCU was called to
evaluate the patient.

The patient was found to be tachypneic and uncomfortable, using
increase work of breathing. He was sating 92% on the
non-rebreather. He was transferred for hypoxic respiratory
distress. In the CCU he endorsed chills, but denied fever, chest
pain, palpitations, nausea, cough, abdominal pain, HA, dysuria,
myalgias, melena.

Respiratory status continued to be tenuous in the CCU requiring
face mask during the day, and BiPap overnight. Patient was not
intubated due to concerns about ability to wean from the vent.
He was treated empirically with broad spectrum.

CCU course notable for increasing respiratory distress requiring
BiPap for comfort. Initially used overnight only with face mask
during the day but increasingly requiring BiPap. Was seen by his
outpatient pulmonologist who agreed with current plan, and felt
patient likely to be difficult to wean from the vent if
intubated. +6L LOS (not counting insensible losses). Admission
weight 53.1kg, currently weighs 56.1 kg(but unreliable as bed
weight with sheets etc). Patient had intermittent A. Fib with
RVR requiring boluses of diltiazem for rate control.

Other Reports

EKG [**2159-4-21**]
Atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions and
uncontrolled ventricular response. Compared to tracing #2 the
heart rate is faster.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
114 0 104 330/424 0 16 -164

CXR [**2159-4-21**]
COMPARISON: Multiple prior chest radiographs from [**2157-1-5**],
[**2157-3-2**], and [**2159-1-17**]. CTA chest was performed on [**2157-3-10**].
CHEST RADIOGRAPH, PA AND LATERAL VIEWS: The patient is status
post median sternotomy, CABG, and coronary artery stenting.
Severe scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine, with deformity of
the left rib cage, again limits evaluation. Left lung volume is
chronically small. Left pleural thickening with calcification is
as before. On the right, there is small pleural effusion which
is new since [**2159-1-17**]. There may be subtle ill-defined opacity
in the right lung base. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
Cardiac enlargement is unchanged.
IMPRESSIONS: Evaluation limited by spine and ribcage deformity.
New small right pleural effusion and subtle opacity in the right
lung base, which could represent aspiration, atelectasis, and/or
developing consolidation.

Echo [**2159-4-23**]
  The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with infero-lateral
hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
  Compared with the report of the prior study (images
unavailable for review) of [**2158-6-13**], no definite change.

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2156-10-4**] demonstrated:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated a normal LMCA with collaterals to RPL. The LAD had
a 90% proximal lesion with competitive flow. The LCX system had
an occluded
OM. The RCA was not selectively engaged.
2. Graft angiography showed a patent SVG to diagonal and OM. The
SVG to RPDA had a 99% proximal stenosis.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics as detailed above revealed
mildly
elevated filling pressures.
4. PCI of SVG-RPDA with 3.5 X 28 mm Cypher DES and no residual
stenosis or complications (see PTCA comments for detail).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG-diagonal-OM graft.
3. Proximal stenosis of SVG-RCA, successful PCI with Cypher
drug-eluting stent.

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2156-10-6**] demonstrated:
1. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with 2.5 X 13 Cypher
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 3.0 with no residual stenosis.
2. Distal LAD myocardial bridge with compression during systole
but
normal flow at diastole.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with Cypher DES.

CXR [**2159-4-22**]
IMPRESSIONS: FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior study from
[**2159-4-21**]. Study is markedly limited due to patient
positioning and the severe scoliosis. Allowing for this,
however, there appears to be opacities within both lower lobes
which are worrisome for consolidation or pneumonia. The
consolidations on the right side are much more apparent than on
the study from yesterday. Aspiration cannot be excluded.

CXR [**2159-4-27**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the volume of
the right hemithorax has decreased. As a consequence, there is
increased crowding of the right perihilar vessels. However,
there is no clear evidence of pneumonia (the film strongly
resembles the examination performed on [**2159-4-24**], 8:03
a.m.). Unchanged marked asymmetry of the chest wall given the
extreme scoliosis. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.

CT chest [**2159-4-28**]
1. Moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent
telectasis/consolidation.
2. Scattered ground-glass opacities with enlarged heart. These
findings are most likely representative of pulmonary edema.
3. Calcified left pleural plaques consistent empyema.
4. Prominent abdominal vessels are limited due to lack of
intravenous
contrast but suggestive of varices. Clinical correlation is
recommended.
5. Marked thoracic cage distortion due to scoliosis.

Pleural fluid [**2159-4-29**]
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

CXR [**2159-5-10**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes are
unchanged. Presence of a minimal right-sided pleural effusion
cannot be
excluded. Minimally increased diameters of the pulmonary vessels
in the right upper lobe could indicate mild overhydration.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged aspect of
the left lung.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course
Professor [**Known lastname 70654**] is a 75 YOM with paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and coronary artery disease who presented with 5
days of fatigue and was found to be in Atrial fibrillaton with
RVR. Patient was admitted to the cardiology service and
dofetilide was initiated given atrial fibrillation. On HD#1
patient develope hypoxic respiratory distress reguiring transfer
to the CCU where he was treated for community acquired pneumonia
with Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Doxycycline given concern for QT
prolongatoin. During his stay in the CCU he was intermittently
in atrial fibrillation with RVR and would intermittently develop
respiratory distress reguiring BiPap.  Patient was eventually
transferred to the MICU for more intensive management of his
pulmonary issues. There the patient completed his course of
antibiotics and was diuresed. Slowly the patients breathing
improved and on [**5-4**] was transfered to the general medical
floor.

Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:
On presentation to the hospital patient was at baseline
pulmonary status. Initial CXR with question of RLL opacity. On
HD#1 patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure which
[**Hospital 70655**] transfer to the CCU and broad spectrum antibiotics to
treat RLL pneumonia visualized on CXR. Further patient became
febrile prior to transfer. Initially patient was thought to have
RLL infiltrate c/w pneumonia and high fever. Patient was treated
for probable RLL pneumonia with Vancomycin, Cefepime, and
Doxycycline completing an 8 day course. On transfer to the MICU
the patient appeared to have superimposed pulmonary edema from
volume resuscitation as evidenced by LOS fluid balance, interval
weight, and clinical exam.  MICU attempted low dose lasix
overnight [**4-27**] for diuresis and monitored respiratory status,
with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  Non-contrast CT
showed moderate right sided pleural effusion. Based upon
patient's respiratory distress, he underwent a 1.5L
thoracentesis on [**4-29**] with interval improvement in respiratory
status. Patient has limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy
and severe kyphoscoliosis and may not tolerate small volumes of
fluid. A Urine legionella was negative. Blood cultures negative
(finalized). Sputum cultures contaminated. Pleural fluid
appeared transudative and cultures NGTD. The patient was
maintained on nebulizers as needed. The patient underwent
aggressive diuresis with IV lasix and was negative
approximately 6 liters for his MICU stay (though even from
admission weight). The patient initially required BiPap around
the clock.  He was weaned to a shovel mask and eventually to a
nasal cannula with diuresis.  He continued on BiPap at night
with his home settings. Based upon radiographic images, there
was concern that patient may be aspirating.  He was evaluated by
speech and swallow who cleared the patient for solids and thin
liquids; pills whole with puree. After diuresis patient
continued to improve, no longer needing BiPAP during the day.
Patient was transferred to the general medical floor where
diuresis was continued. The patient was maintained on nasal
cannula 1-2L for a week, and finally weaned down to RA, satting
mid90s on discharge. The patient was discharged on Lasix and
Aldactone.

Atrial fibrillation:
On admission to the hospital patient was found to be in atrial
fibrillation. With therapeutic INRs for the past two months.
Decision was made to start dofetilide. Patient initially
converted to sinus rhythm prior to transfer to CCU. During CCU
stay patient was paroxysmally in atrial fibrillation which was
intermittently controlled with diltiazem.  The patient was
continued on dofetilide per EP recommendations, and daily EKGs
were initially obtained to monitor for QT prolongation.  The
patient's diltiazem was up-titrated as tolerated.  At the time
of leaving the MICU, he was on Diltiazem Extended Release 240mg
PO BID.  He was in sinus rhythm. On the floor, the patient was
intermittently in afib. He was started on Metoprolol 25mg PO BID
for better heart rate control. He was intermittently in afib and
junction rhythm (rate 60s-80s). Dofetilide was discontinued on
[**5-14**]. He was discharged on Dilt 240mg PO BID, Metoprolol 25mg PO
BID.

Metabolic alkalosis:
Thought to be secondary to aggressive diuresis with lasix
(contraction alkalosis). Correction may help respiratory status
by preventing compensatory hypoventilation. On his last day in
the MICU, he was started on acetazolamide 250 mg [**Hospital1 **].

Junctional Bradycardia:
Likely secondary to beta-blockers.  The patient was started on
Metoprolol, as recommended by EP. The patient was noted to be in
a junctional rhythm, but was not bradycardic.

Coronary artery disease:
post CABG and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2.  ST depressions on EKG (stable, but
worsened with tachycardia to 150s).  No active chest pain.
Cardiac enzymes negative. The patient was continued on aspirin
81 mg and his home dose Lipitor.

Hypernatremia:
The patient was intermittently hypernatremic while in the MICU,
most recently with Na 146 on [**5-4**] free water deficit of 1.4L. He
intermittently received D5W X 1000 cc and PO intake was
encouraged.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 70654**],
.
It was a pleasure caring for you while you were hospitalized
with fatigue and shortness of breath. During your stay your
breathing became extremely labored [**Hospital 70656**] transfer to the
Intensive Care Unit were you were treated with antibiotics for
pneumonia. While in the ICU your breathing was slow to improve
so you were also diuresed with IV diuretics (lasix). Slowly your
breathing improved and you were transfered to regular medical
floor. Throughout this time your heart rate was in and out of
atrial fibrillation. Electrophysiology recommended Diltiazem and
Metoprolol for good rate control. You were also on Dofetilide
which was stopped since it did not keep you in a normal heart
rhythm.
.
Please take all your medications as prescribed and keep all of
your follow up appointments. Weigh yourself every morning, and
call your physician if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs. You
should also have lab work checked at your visit on [**2159-5-18**] to
ensure your kidney function and electrolytes are normal.
.
The following changes were made to your medication regimen:
#. CHANGE Atenolol to Metoprolol 25mg by mouth twice daily
#. STOP Nifedipine
#. START Diltiazem 240mg by mouth twice daily
#. START Miconazole powder twice a day as needed for you groin
rash
#. Start Lasix 20mg daily on [**2159-5-17**] (Call PCP and stop if you
feel lightheaded or dizzy)
#. Start Aldactone 12.5mg daily on [**2159-5-17**] )Call PCP and stop if
you feel lightheaded or dizzy)
#. We also increased your mirtazapine to 30mg at nighttime
#. DECREASE your aspirin to 81 mg daily
