HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old man with
CAD, PVD who had difficulty speaking after left carotid
endarterectomy in [**2133-2-16**].  The patient has had bilateral
carotid stenosis.  On [**2-21**] while he was sitting in a chair he
developed sudden onset of right arm and leg numbness,
followed by right arm and leg weakness.  He also had
difficulty speaking.  He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **]
and underwent a left carotid endarterectomy on [**2-26**] and
afterwards began having severe left sided headache behind his
left eye that lasted for hours and was constant.
Nevertheless, he visited [**Hospital3 **] for continued
headaches and nausea and vomiting.  During one of those
visits he had a contortion of his right face and bilateral
arm jerking and was started on Dilantin with presumptive
diagnosis of seizures.  He has recovered from that event when
was again discharged home.  On [**3-13**] he again presented with
persistent headaches, confusion and inability to talk.  He
had difficulty getting his words out.  He had a head CT at
[**Hospital3 **] which showed a linear hyperintense region
in the left central temporal lobe but also other lesions in
the left posterior parietal lobes.  At that time he was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**].  MRI
of his head showed left MCA/ACA and left MCA/PCA watershed
strokes with acute and subacute hemorrhage conversions.  It
was thought at that time that he had extended his watershed
infarcts after carotid endarterectomy leading to a carotid
hyperperfusion syndrome.  The patient was discharged from the
neurologic Intensive Care Unit to a rehab facility.  On
Thursday, [**2133-3-26**], patient's wife noticed erythema on
patient's face.  On [**3-27**] the visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) 8706**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11282**] of
a rash on his arms as well.  The patient was noted to be
febrile and was admitted to the [**Company 191**] Firm.  In the EW,
patient's Dilantin was discontinued and he was given Tegretol
instead.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Left CEA in [**2133-2-16**].  2) CVA in
[**2133-2-16**].  3) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  4)  CAD.  5)
PVD.  6) Hypercholesterolemia.  7) History of amaurosis
fugax.  8) Status post lymph node removal.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Lopressor 25 mg po bid, Dilantin
200 mg po tid, Prilosec 40 mg po q day, Lipitor, Ambien.

ALLERGIES:  Iodine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 3146**], tobacco since
[**2126**], one pint of alcohol per day.  The patient works as a
carpenter.

FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 98.3, pulse
86, blood pressure 94/65, respiratory rate 18, saturations
96% on room air.  In general, alert, oriented times three, no
apparent distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light, mucus membranes moist, oropharynx clear.
No lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm,
no murmurs.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen soft, nontender, non distended, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities, no cyanosis, erythema, edema.  Neuro,
cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Skin red maculopapular
blanching erythema on face, torso and extremities, sparing
the soles.  Bilateral lower extremity petechiae, no
significant oral lesions noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Derm:  Over the course of patient's stay on [**Company 191**] Firm,
patient had rigors and fevers of up to 101 degree.  The
patient was initially continued on Tegretol.  The patient had
worsening rash throughout his torso with lip swelling and
tongue swelling.  The patient did not experience any
respiratory difficulties throughout the course of his stay on
the [**Company 191**] service.  A derm consult was obtained.  The
dermatology team recommended discontinuing Tegretol.  Their
thought was that the patient's symptoms were secondary to his
hypersensitivity to Dilantin.  The patient was treated
symptomatically with IV fluids, Zantac, Benadryl and Synalar
cream.  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit overnight for observation given risk of respiratory
distress.  [**Hospital **] Medical Intensive Care Unit stay was
uneventful.  Skin biopsy was also consistent with
hypersensitivity reaction.  Over the course of patient's stay
in the hospital, patient's rash started to improve with
decreasing erythema and edema.

2.  Neuro:  Patient was seen by neurology service.  They
recommended stopping all anti-epileptic medications since
they thought that his symptoms were likely secondary to
carotid reperfusion syndrome and anti-seizure medications are
not necessarily beneficial under these circumstances.

3.  GI:  Patient's LFTs were slightly elevated during his
admission.  The patient's Lipitor was held due to increased
LFTs.  His increased LFTs were likely secondary to Dilantin.
Patient to follow-up with his PCP to make sure LFTs are
trending down and before restarting Lipitor.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Dilantin hypersensitivity reaction.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg po bid, Zantac 150 mg
po bid, Synalar ointment, Eucerin cream.  Discharged to home.
patient to follow-up with PCP next week as well as with
dermatology.  Patient's PCP to assess blood pressure before
restarting Atenolol.
