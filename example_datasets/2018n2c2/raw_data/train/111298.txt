recently she describes them as occuring just left of the vertex.
She would get these headaches about 20 days per months since its
onset in [**Month (only) **]. At its worst, the headache would go up to a [**6-16**]
in intensity and twice it resulted in her vomiting.
Occasionally,
it would be assoicated with photophobia but no son[**Name (NI) **]. Of
note, there is a positional nature to these headaches as she
says

lightheadedness with positional changes, but no vertigo. No
strength or sensory changes, no visual changes and no weight
loss
noted since [**Month (only) **]. Her parents have not noted any behavioral

her forehead accidentally on the counter while bartending. No

IMAGING:
CT Head [**10-9**]:
1. A large lesion in the right frontal lobe, measuring 6.8 x 5.2
x 9 cm, seen to extend into the region of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the right lateral ventricle, and in proximity to the septum
pellucidum. Given the large size and lack of priors, the exact
site of origin of the lesion is not clear. This can either
represent a low-grade neoplasm vs a complex cyst, with the
differential diagnosis including subependymoma, pleomorphic
xanthoastrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, the latter two being less
likely given the pattern of enhancement and lack of
calcifications. An unusual complex cyst cannot be completely
excluded. The lesion does appear to have some vascularity, with
tiny vessels noted within the lesion. Wet read was entered on
[**2164-10-9**], soon after the study.

CT Head [**10-11**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Expected post-surgical changes, status post right frontal
mass removal.
2. Interval decrease of mass effect when compared to prior study
([**2164-10-11**]). No hemorrhage or major vascular territorial
infarction is noted.

MRI Head [**10-12**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of infarction.
2. FLAIR abnormality around the surgical resection margin may be
related to recent surgery, though residual tumor cannot be
excluded. While there is no abnormal enhancement, there is no
enhancement of the tumor prior to surgery, so this cannot be
used as metric.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after having an MRI of her
brain for consistent headaches as an outpatient which showed her
to have a right frontal mass which communicated with the right
lateral ventricle. She was evaluated by neuromedicine and
neurosurgery in the ED and was admitted to the neurosurgery
service. A CTA/V was obtained to gain information on the
vascularity of the mass. On the evening of [**10-10**] it was decided
that she would undergo surgical resection of the mass via
craniotomy on the morning of [**10-11**].  She remained stable on the
floor overnight and on [**10-11**] was taken to the OR for surgery.
Surgery was without complication. She was admitted to the ICU
but remained in the PACU overnight. Post op CT revealed good
resection and no hemorrhage.
ON POD#1 she was neurologically intact. She was cleared for
transfer to the floor. post op MRI was completed and also
revealed excellent resection. PCA was discontinued and she was
started on PO pain meds with IV for breakthourgh. She did
require some IV pain medication on [**10-13**] and remained on her PO
regimen. She was able to mobilize OOB on this day and walk
through the halls without difficulty. She was somewhat
orthostatic and complained of dizziness on [**10-14**] when ambulating
and she was started on 50cc/hr of IVF and had no further issues.


She was discharged to home on [**2164-10-15**].
