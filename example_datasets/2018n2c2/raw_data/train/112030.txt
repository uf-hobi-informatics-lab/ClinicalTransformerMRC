Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
79M with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma s/p metal biliary stent
placement [**11-8**], who presents with fever x 1 day following
repeat ERCP. Pt is a very poor historian, so most of the history
is obtained through chart review and ED providers. The patient
stated that he had the ERCP done, returned home, felt really
fatigued and unable to walk ([**3-7**] leg pain and weakness). His
wife called 911 and he was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Denied any chest
pain, abd pain, nausea, vomiting. +fevers to 104 at home, +
chills. No headaches. No LOC, no h/o syncope.
.
Patient had second, outpatient ERCP by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the day
prior to admission due to increasing pruritis and a CT at [**Hospital1 **] that suggesting tumor ingrowth into the stent. He was
pretreated with ampicillin 2gm IV, and gentamicin 80mg IV. ERCP
demonstrated a malignant-appearing biliary stricture affecting
the hilumand right and left ducts. There was debris visible with
in the stent at early cholangiogram. Occulsion cholangiograqm
revealed extensive stricturing of both left and right
intrahepatic ducts. Although a small left intrahepatic radical
opacified, it was not possible to advance the balloon catheter
in this direction. For this reason, no stent could be
introduced. Balloon sweeps were performed from just above the
stent and down through the stent, and a moderate amount of
debris was removed. Even after multiple sweeps, there was some
filling defect left in the upperprotion of the stent, consistent
with a degree of tumor ingrowth. Sticture not amenable to ERCP,
and suggested PTCA as next intervention if futher obstructive
symptoms occur. He was NOT discharged on any anti-biotic ppx.
.
Today pt presents with fever to 103.8, no [**Last Name (un) 103**] pain. no
nausea/no vomiting. c/o fatigue, with reported fevers at home of
103.8--pt took tylenol. In ED, hemodynamically stable.
clinically appears well. wcc is 20. pt was pancultured and
started on levo and flagyl per ercp fellow who review pt in am
for consideration of ir guided drainage if abscess present. ct
in er was equivocal regards to this. pt was therefore admitted
for iv rehydration, iv abx and possible ir procedure. Apparently
had an episode of unresponsiveness in the ED + incontinence.
Stat Head CT ordered--negative. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3271**] requested a neuro
consult on the floor.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T98.8; HR 63; BP 107/57; rr 16, O2
sat 96%. No nausea/vomting reported. No abdominal pain. Blood cx
sent. IVF given, levo, flagyl given as well. Pt was schdeduled
to go to the regular floor but at 2305; pt was found to be
unresponsive, diaphoretic and incontinent of stool. T 102.0(R);
hr 57; BP 104/45; rr 21 O2 sat 97%2L. BS 246 at the time. Per
nsg report, got up to go to the bathroom, felt off, ? syncopal
event; got back into bed, was found by nurse to be unresponsive
and was incontinent of stool. Pt woke up after sternal rub,
alert and oriented x 3. CT scan was ordered in the ED--negative.
Of note, but had a recent 40-50lbs weight loss over last year.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient's complaint was fatigue
and leg pain. Vital signs were stable. No abdominal pain, no
nausea, no vomiting.

      ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
         Trimethoprim/Sulfa sensitivity testing available on
request.

BOTTLE.
.
surveillance blood cx from [**4-19**] and [**4-20**]: no growth to date
.
EKG:
Sinus rhythm with atrial sensing and ventricular pacing. No
previous tracing available for comparison.
.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are mild dependent
changes at the lung bases. A biliary stent is noted in the
common duct. Moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is
noted. Near the porta hepatis and adjacent to the proximal end
of the biliary stent is an approximately 5.7 x 3.7-cm area of
hypodensity of the hepatic parenchyma with ill-defined borders.
Multiple smaller satellite low-attenuation hepatic foci with
similar ill- defined appearance are noted. There is associated
moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. There is no
defined fluid collection and no subcapsular or perihepatic
fluid. There is no ascites or intraperitoneal focal fluid
collection or abscess. The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands,
stomach and bowel are unremarkable. At the upper pole of the
right kidney is a 3.1-cm exophytic lesion which measures 28
Hounsfield units, higher than expected for a simple cyst.
Smaller bilateral parapelvic cysts are noted. There are
bilateral extrarenal pelves. There is no pathologic mesenteric
or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, urinary bladder
and pelvic loops of bowel are unremarkable. The prostate is
mildly enlarged. There is no free pelvic fluid or
lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions
are identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. 5.7 x 3.7 cm region of low attenuation of the hepatic
parenchyma near the porta hepatis with ill-defined borders and
multiple smaller satellite hypodense foci. These findings are
thought more likely to represent primary cholangiocarcinoma with
intrahepatic metastases. The possibility of superinfection
cannot be definitively excluded. Evaluation with ultrasound
could be helpful to determine if there is a fluid component. If
so, this could be aspirated for diagnostic purposes.
2. Bilateral parapelvic renal cysts.
3. 3.1-cm exophytic lesion of the right kidney measures greater
density than expected for a simple cyst. Ultrasound is suggested
to determine if this is a cyst or possibly a solid lesion.
.
RUQ ULTRASOUND:
FINDINGS: There is mild edema within the gallbladder wall which
may be seen with liver disease. The gallbladder is relaxed and
no pericholecystic fluid is identified to suggest cholecystitis.
As noted on prior CT, there is intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. Upper pole cyst is identified on the right kidney
measuring 3.1 cm x 3 cm x 2.1 cm. No fluid collections around
the liver or gallbladder are identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. No fluid collections identified in or around the liver or
gallbladder.
2. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation also noted on CT one
day previous.
3. Edema within the gallbladder wall which may be seen with
liver disease. No evidence of acute cholecystitis identified.
.
AP CXR:
Heart size top normal. Lungs clear. No edema or pleural
effusion. Fullness in the mediastinum at the thoracic inlet to
the right of midline could be due to goiter or tortuous head and
neck vessels. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular
pacer leads in standard placements. No pneumothorax or pleural
effusion.
.
HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST:
FINDINGS: No definite evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or
hydrocephalus. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation appears grossly
preserved. Several areas of relative [**Name (NI) 33214**] is seen
within vessels, including the MCAs and vertebrals, possibly
secondary to recent contrast administration. Visualized
paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. MRI
with diffusion-weighted images is more sensitive in the
evaluation for acute ischemia/infarct and for vascular detail.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Gram negative septicemia due to cholangitis: Bacteremia may
have been secondary to manipulation during ERCP.  RUQ ultrasound
showed no evidence of cholecystitis.  Culture grew enterobacter.
 Patient received ampicillin and gentamicin while in house and
was discharged on po cipro.  Surveillance blood cultures remain
negative.  Plan for total of 14 days of antibiotics.  Patient is
hemodynamically stable.  LFTs are steadily improving.
Percutaneous biliary drain was discussed but was not necessary
given bili trending down with the cleaning of the stent done on
initial ERCP.
.
2) Cholangiocarcinoma/locally metastatic, growing into the
stent, obstructing bile ducts:  Patient is currently under
hospice care.
.
3) Syncope: Pacer was interrogated.  Episode of ? VT noted but
did not temporally correlate with patient's episode.  More
likely this was due to transient hypotension in the setting of
his sepsis.  However, could certainly consider AICD once
bacteremia completely treated given concurrent low EF (EF
20-30%).  However, patient is in hospice and likely would
refuse.  This was not discussed during his inhospital course.
Neuro exam was normal and head CT was negative.  Orthostatics
were negative.  No significant arrhythmias on tele other than a
transient tachycardia EP believes was possibly afib/flutter,
ventricularly paced.
.
4) Renal cyst:  Incidental finding on CT.  Consider follow-up
ultrasound to better characterize, as recommended, if patient
agreeable.
.
5) h/o CAD: Patient is on an aspirin and a beta blocker.  He
denied any chest pain.  His statin was held due to bump in LFTs.
 Could consider restarting at follow-up but likely little
benefit given overall prognosis and patient will continue to be
at risk of recurrent transaminitis.
.
6) h/o colitis: Patient was continued on his home Asacol,
Anaspaz
.
7) ARF: Resolved with IVF.  Likely prerenal.  Please resume
diovan at follow-up visit if creatinine and blood pressure
remain stable.
.
8) Coagulopathy: Resolved with vitamin K.  Inr 1.9 on admit, now
1.4.
.
9) Dispo: discharged home with prior hospice services
.
10) Code status: DNR/DNI
