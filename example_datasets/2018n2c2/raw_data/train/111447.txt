Chief Complaint:
Wheezing and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
59 yo man with severe asthma who originally presented w/ 3 days
of worsening dyspnea c/w prior exacerbations, now transferred to
the Medicine team for ongoing care. He had asthma exacerbation 3
wks ago requiring prednisone taper, which he completed about 1
wk ago.  Over the past few days, he has had productive cough and
pleuritic chest pain, but no F/C. Went to [**Location (un) **] HC on day
of admission and was treated w/ albuterol/atroven nebs and
solumedrol, but symptoms were unrelieved, prompting referral of
pt to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. In ED, he was placed on continuous nebs and
given prednisone 40 mg, then admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ongoing
care.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], ABG was 7.29/47/83, which was concerning
for respiratory fatigue.  He was treated w/ heliox and
eventually offered BiPAP, though he refused BiPAP treatment.
Though he was afebrile, empiric treatment for CAP was begun w/
ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  He was found to have RSV
infection on viral culture, which is a likely explanation for
his current asthma exacerbation.  His respiratory status
improved steadily until the present time, when he is transferred
to the Medicine team for ongoing care.

Currently, the pt complains of ongoing dyspnea and cough that
are moderately controlled w/ nebulized albuterol.  He complains
of lumbar back pain that is partially relieved by percocet.
Denies any fever, chills, abd pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, hematochezia, and melena.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Asthma Exacerbation: Pt's nasal washings returned positive
for RSV.  On admission he had marked wheezing and poor air
movement, with ABG of [**2142-9-4**]/83.  He gradually improved on
solumedrol, continuous nebs, advair, singulair, heliox, Azithro
(5 days) and Ceftriaxone.  Pt did not require intubation, and
his nebs were spaced out to q4hrs.  Pt's breathing was
comfortable and non-wheezy by HD#5 when observed from the door,
however, pt appears to exagerate end-expiratory wheezing and
laboured breathing when approached.  He was felt to have a
component of psychogenic dyspnea overlying his asthma
exacerbation.  He was slowly titrated down on his steroid dose,
and he frequently requested to be placed on higher doses of
steroids despite an improving exam and vitals.  Eventually, he
had both subjectively and objectively improved to the point
where he was tolerating oral steroids and was able to be
discharged home on a taper with plans to follow-up with his
outpatient pulmonologist.

2. Psych/Neuro: Cocaine Abuse and Opioid Dependence.  Pt's urine
tox screen was positive for cocaine and opioids.  Pt was
requiring two percocets every 4 hours for low back pain s/p
laminectomy.  Attempts to wean his percocets were made in effort
to minimize suppression of his cough.  However, pt was unhappy
with this recommendation and insisted on his usual dose of
percocets, stating that the wheezing/coughing greatly
exacerbated the back pain.  He was seen by the addictions
consult and social work while he was an inpatient; their
discussions culminated in an agreement that Mr. [**Known lastname **] would seek
outpatient counseling for his substance abuse difficulties,
which are both worsened by and worsen his chronic pain.
He was discharged on a brief course of oxycodone/acetaminophen,
with the understanding that should he have ongoing pain
medication requirements, he would need to finally establish a
primary care physician; he has been stating that this is
something he would do, but has failed to do so for months.  He
was provided with multiple names and numbers of providers in his
area, and he informed the team that he was dedicated to being
seen by one of them.

3. Hypertension: Pt was hypertensive on admission in setting of
his acute asthma exacerbation.  He continued to be hypertensive
and HCTZ was started, with a good effect and was tolerated well.
 His electrolytes and renal function remained stable on this new
medication, and he was advised to see a primary care doctor to
follow both this and his numerous other medical issues.
