83 yo gentleman with little PMHx was admitted from ERCP suite
with history epigastric pain.

He was initially admitted to [**Hospital6 204**] (LGH) 10
days ago with acute on chronic epigastric pain and diagnosed
with pancreatitis. Additional review of systems is notable for
the following: intermittent epigastric pain and anorexia over
last 3-4 months. He denies fevers or jaundice. At LGH, labs were
notable for leukocytosis with WBC >20,000, increasing serum and
fluid amylase levels with serial fluid amylase readings of
[**2156**]-3600s. Imaging was notable for the following: abdominal CT
with peripancreatic and ascitic fluid; MRI which revealed an
amorphous pancreatic head suggestive of hemorrhagic
pancreatitis. A paracentesis was performed on [**2166-4-28**], and fluid
total protein was elevated, a SAAG was near zero, and fluid cell
count revealed WBC 1700 with neutrophilic predominance. For
treatment, he was started empirically on Unasyn on [**2166-4-26**] and
then changed to Zosyn on [**2166-4-29**]. He also had a drain placed
into one of his abdominal fluid collections. Additional issues
include the following:
- malnutrition - He was started on TPN in the setting of being
NPO and with marked hypoalbuminemia with Alb 1.5.
- anemia - He received 1 unit pRBCs.
- Atrial Fibrillation - He developed rapid afib on [**2166-4-29**]. He
was initially started on diltiazem with minimal improvement, and
he was then transitioned to amiodarone.  A pigtail drain was
placed [**2166-5-1**] to drain ascitic fluid.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Assessment for ERCP and possible
transpapillary drainage with stenting.  Finger stick glucose was
elevated to 225 this afternoon.

[**Hospital1 18**] STUDIES:
[**2166-5-5**] ERCP
1. Edematous major papilla
2. The bile duct was not dilated. The distal bile duct filled
poorly, most likely due to extrinsic compression from the
pathology at the pancreatic head. No filling defects were noted.

3. Contrast was injected into the pancreatic duct, which
appeared to terminate abruptly in the pancreatic head, with no
filling beyond that point.  This is in keeping with the reported
MRCP findings and is concerning for an obstructing pancreatic
mass.

[**2166-5-6**] Endoscopic Ultrasound
1. A 3.2 cm X 4.1 cm discrete anechoic lesion, consistent with a
cyst was noted in the head of the pancreas.
2. The walls of the cyst were thick measuring 0.22cm.
3. Layering debris was noted in the dependent part of the cyst.
4. A pseudoaneurysm was noted on the lateral wall of the cyst.
5. The cyst appeared to obstruct the main pancreatic duct, which
was dilated distally. The cyst was also noted to compress the
portal vein.
6.  A single perigastric lymph node was noted, which measured
1.8 x 0.8cm.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

[**2166-5-7**] CTA Abd/Pelvis
1. Multiple areas of fluid collection throughout the abdomen
including the
large bilobed pseudocyst above and below the pancreas, in the
right paracolic gutter, transverse mesentery, and within
anterior abdominal wall.
2. 6-mm pseudoaneurysm located within the pseudocyst at the
level of the
pancreas. There is also a 10-mm aneurysm at the origin of the
common hepatic artery.
3. Dilatation of the main pancreatic duct due to compressive
effect of the
pseudocyst.



Brief Hospital Course:
83yo male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for
evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large
pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid
collections thought related to his pseudocyst. His course was
complicated by unexplained PEA arrest. The patient had an ICU
course s/p resuscitation wherein he did not regain mental
faculties or responsiveness. His family chose comfort measures
and Mr. [**Known lastname 59996**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2166-5-19**].

# PEA arrest - unclear precipitant. Patient never regained
mental faculties.

1. Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
Collections
On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect,
suggestive of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS
which revealed a large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was
also performed, which confirmed the large pseudocysts but also
noted multiple large abdominal fluid collections. He was
evaluated by our general surgery team, who thought his abdominal
process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation was
relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage
at this time was not indicated. He developed a bleeding GDA
aneurysm and was taken to IR for embolization before which he
developed PEA arrest. This GDA was ultimately embolized.

2. Clostridium difficile infection
Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased
diarrhea and marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff
positive and started on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his
diarrhea. He was recommended to continue flagyl for 2 weeks from
4/7-20/10.

3. Hepatic Cirrhosis
Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis,
although patient has no history of this in the past.

4. Atrial Fibrillation
Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and
was started on diltiazem before being transitioned to
amiodarone. Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], his PICC line was noted to
be advanced into the right atrium, and it was thought that this
may have been triggering his atrial fibrillation. During his
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**], he remained in sinus rhythm and with
excellent rate control. His amiodarone was discontinued.

5. Acute Renal Failure
During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as
1.9 and then remained stable between .[**8-31**].

6. Malnutrition
Patient was started on TPN at the OSH and was continued on this
during his hospitalization. He was NPO during this
hospitalization and was NPO on discharge. At rehab, we recommend
that he remain NPO for the first week. He could take sips for
comfort after this time.

7. Anemia
Unknown baseline. His hematocrit has remained stable during this
admission from 27-30.

8. Hyperglycemia
He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 25354**] and was continued on insulin during his
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**].

9. Family Contact
Patient's family contact is the patient's niece [**Name (NI) 86401**]
