Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
headache, syncope, generalized seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy (twice) for BAL.
TEE
Evacuation of left-sided retroperitoneal hematoma


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a mechanical mitral
valve, on coumadin, and hypertension.  On [**2147-7-14**], he awoke
feeling generally unwell.  His wife called EMS and - en route to
[**Name (NI) **] Hospital - the patient had a generalized convulsion.
The patient had a second generalized convulsion upon entry to
the [**Location (un) **] ER, he developed a massive tongue hematoma from a
tongue bite, and underwent a difficult and prolonged intubation
process.  INR was 3.2, which was in the appropriate range given
the mechanical valve.  NCHCT revealed ICH and SAH.  He was
loaded with 1 gram of dilantin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

At [**Hospital1 18**], CTA revealed left sylvian fissure subarachnoid
hemorrhage extending
to parietal sulci, 4-mm aneurysm at the left MCA bifurcation
pointing laterally, 2 to 2.5 mm aneurysm arising from the A2
segment of the left anterior cerebral artery at the level of
ventricular bodies.  In the ED,
the patient received Factor 9 and 1 unit FFP. He subsequently
received 6 units of platelets and FFP to reverse his
coagulopathy. He was started on nimodipine and HOB was kept > 30
degrees.

A subsequent conventional angiogram further delineated the
aneurysms; the Neurosurgery team felt that these aneurysms were
unlikely to be the cause of the patient??????s bleeding.  Since there
would be no further surgical intervention, the patient was
transferred to the Neurology team in the ICU.

IMAGING:
.
Admssion CTA CNS:
1. Left sylvian fissure subarachnoid hemorrhage extending to
parietal sulci.
2. 4-mm aneurysm at the left MCA bifurcation pointing laterally.

3. 2 to 2.5 mm aneurysm arising from the A2 segment of the left
anterior
cerebral artery at the level of ventricular bodies.
.
CT head [**2147-8-8**]: No evidence of acute new hemorrhage. Area of
prior hemorrhage in the left subinsular region is less apparent.
.
MRI/A: CNS:
1. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage along the left Sylvian
fissure
and left occipital lobe with left temporal lobe hemorrhage,
magnetic
susceptibility change is also noted on the left frontal lobe,
raising the
possibility of chronic hemorrhage or microbleed (5:16), residual

intraventricular hemorrhage.
2. The previously noted aneurysms on the left ACA and left MCA
are not
clearly identified in this examination.
3. Sequela of a prior infarction is noted on the right
cerebellar hemisphere.
4. Restricted diffusion is noted on the left parietal lobe
likely consistent with subacute ischemic changes, measuring
approximately 6 x 7 mm.

Cerebral arteriography:
2-mm aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery at the origin
of the anterior temporal branch.
This was thought not to be responsible for his left sylvian
fissure hemorrhage as there was no history of headache at onset
and the
hemorrhage itself was located remote from the aneurysm and there
was no blood in the basal cisterns at all.
A second aneurysm measuring 1.5-2 mm was also located in the
left pericallosal artery. The A1 was dominant on the left side
.
TTE: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild
regional systolic dysfunction. Normal functioning aortic
bileaflet prosthesis. At least mild mitral regurgitation
.
Carotid dupplex showed:  Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA
stenosis <40%
.
CT chest/abd/pelvis;
1. Large 7 x 9 x 18 cm measuring retroperitoneal hematoma in the
iliopsoas
and iliacus muscle
2. Pleural calcifications consistent with asbestos exposure and
atelectasis in
bilateral lungs with round atelectasis in the right lower lobe
3. Gastric pull-up is visualized status post esophagectomy for
esophageal
cancer.
.
RUQ U/S: Slight increased echogenicity in the liver. More
advanced forms
of liver disease such as fibrosis / cirrhosis not excluded.
Otherwise normal right upper quadrant ultrasound without
evidence of biliary abnormality.
.
L knee X-ray [**2147-8-8**]:
 Probable undisplaced tibial fracture, with a large joint
effusion
presumably representing hemarthrosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. mental status/neuro exam: The patient's baseline is oriented
to place, occasionally date (usually knows [**2146**], not month). He
has bizarre/tangential speech at times, and becomes temporarily
confused. He has 5/5 strength in upper extremities, 4-/5 in
lower extremities at both proximal and distal muscles, thought
to be secondary to deconditioning and ICU myopathy (not due to
stroke). He has 2+ reflexes on right, 1+ on left. Upgoing
Babinski on right.
.
#. seizures:
The patient presented after generalized seizures, complicated by
tongue biting and hematoma. Head CT showed left-sided
intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage.   It was unknown
whether bleeding was the precipitating event, followed by
seizure due to parenchymal irritation; or, if seizure occurred
initially and trauma sustained during the convulsion led to
bleeding. The patient was loaded with Dilantin and then
initiated on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis since this does not
interact with coumadin. He had no further seizure activity int
he ICU. After transfer to the medical floor, the patient had an
episode of lower extremity shaking while asleep in a chair,
witnessed only by wife. This was thought unlikely to represent
seizure activity, and more likely myoclonic jerks during sleep.
Neurology was called to see patient at this time. 20 minute EEG
was done, showing no epileptiform activity. The patient will
continue on Keppra for at least 6 months. He will follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in neurology.
.
#. ICH:
The patient underwent a conventional angiogram which did show
2-mm aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery at the origin
of the anterior temporal branch. However, this was thought not
to be responsible for his left sylvian fissure hemorrhage as
there was no history of headache at onset and the
hemorrhage itself was located remote from the aneurysm and there
was no blood in the basal cisterns at all. He did have an
intraparenchimal bleed with a SAH component that may have been
due to amyloid angiopathy and microbleeds in GRE. These added to
his age and PV white matter disease placed him at a higher risk
for a new bleed. However, he needed to remain anticoagulated
because of his mechanical valve. Thoracic surgery was consulted
about the possibility of pursuing a valve replacement for a
biological prosthesis to avoid anticoagulation. However, the
surgical risk was determined to outweigh the benefit of avoiding
anticoagulation. The patient remained off anticoagulation due to
this high risk. On [**7-18**], the patient developed new right-sided
weakness and MRI showed new left MCA infarct. This was thought
to have originated from AVR thromboembolization. Heparin was
resumed for goal PTT 40-60 and coumadin was resumed [**8-1**]. Several
repeat head CT have all been stable, most recent [**2147-8-8**].
Heparin infusion was stopped once a therapeutic INR was reached
on warfarin.
.
#. Retroperitoneal Bleed:
After the patient had a stroke off anticoagulation, heparin was
resumed.  Shortly after, the patient developed worsening anemia
with HCT eventually falling to 19.  He received a total of 15
units pRBCs during the hospital course.  His systolic blood
pressure dropped to the 80s and he became tachycardic.  A CT
abd/pelvis revealed a large retroperitoneal hematoma.  He
required very aggressive transfusion of RBCs and underwent
evacuation of hematoma by vascular surgery on [**7-27**].  He
tolerated the procedure well and hematocrit has been stable
since the procedure.  His heparin was resumed with goal PTT
40-60 on [**7-30**] and was restarted on coumadin [**8-1**].
.
The patient was transferred to the neuromedicine step-down
service on [**8-1**].  He was noted to have intermittant fevers.  CT
of the torso and head did not reveal any new source. He became
hypotensive and Hct continued to decrease. EKG was concerning
for new T wave inversions and a stat ECHO showed possible
anterior wall motion abnormality, most likely intracranial T
waves.  The patient responded to IV fluids and placement in
trendelenberg.  This event was presumed to be due to continued
retroperitoneal bleeding. Anticoagulation was again held
temporarily.
The patient was eventually safely anticoagulated and INR was 3.0
on day of discharge. The patient's coumadin was being held for
supratherapeutic INR prior to discharge. PT and PTT are
elevated, likely due to poor nutritional status. INR will need
to be monitored daily and coumadin adjusted appropriately to
maintain goal range 2.5-3.5.  He should have daily INR checks
and adjustment of dose to maintain INR 2.5-3.5.  At the time of
discharge, he was restarted on coumadin 4.0 mg daily.
His hematocrit is currently 27.9 and stable.

#. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to a large
tongue hematoma.  On [**7-24**] (after extubation) he was found to
have increased respiration rate and work of breathing.  He had a
clot removed from his trachea by ENT with moderate resolution of
symptoms.  He is currently doing well on room air.

#. Ventilator-associated PNA: The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
also complicated by persistent fevers and leukocytosis secondary
to pneumonia while intubated. He underwent 2 bronchoscopies with
BAL and samples grew klebsiella, serratia, and staph aureus.  He
completed a 12-day course of antibiotics, initially started on
vancomycin and cefepime.  He is currently afebrile with no
leukocytosis.

#. Gout: The patient developed erythema, swelling and pain of
the left 1st MTP joint, consistent with gout. He has a prior
history of gout, so no joint aspiration was done. The patient
responded well to colchicine with reduced pain and inflammation.

#. Left knee trauma: The patient fell from bed in MICU. X-ray
showed possible small nondisplaced tibial fracture, but unable
to see joint line. The patient was weight bearing well with PT.

#. HTN: The patient was continued on metoprolol and Imdur.

#. Code status: DNR
