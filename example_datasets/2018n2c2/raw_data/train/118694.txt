Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Eye surgery

History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 yo female with a history of laryngeal spasm,
possible asthma, and anxiety who underwent elective L eye
cataract removal and trabeculectomy today under general
anestesia with LMA, PACU course complicated by respiratory
distress. She has had prior issues post-op with laryngeal spasm,
sometimes requiring intubation. Her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] notes that her
asthma dx is not clear, and that when she has been intubated,
there does not appear to be any obstructive issues, suggesting
most of her symptoms are upper airway in nature. She has
responded inconsistently to heliox in the past, and at her last
admission at OSH did not tolerate NPPV well, but responded well
to clonazepam.

Regarding recent events, per anesthesia and nursing, she
initially developed dry cough, followed by progressive tachypnea
and dyspnea over the afternoon (from ~2pm to 7pm). Was given
albuterol and ipratropium nebs without significant effect.
Called by anesthesia to see patient around 7pm, given RR
reaching upper 30s and concern for need of NPPV vs invasive
ventilation. Had recently received 60mg solumedrol and racemic
epinephrine without significant effect. Patient notes feeling
dyspneic with dry cough intermittently, as well as wheezy. She
denies fatigue, stating she knows what that implies. No fevers,
pain, dysuria, nausea, vomiting. Detailed ROS not obtained in
setting of patient's respiratory distress.

cycle - noted over upper airway and appears to transmit
throughout lung fields, poor air movement

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 61 yo female with a history of laryngeal spasm,
possible asthma, and anxiety who is in the ICU for respiratory
distress s/p elective eye surgery.

# Respiratory distress: Felt most likely related to paradoxical
vocal cord motion, although quite difficult to tell from
physical exam alone. Panting maneuver did alleviate wheezing.
ENT evaluated and noted only mild upper airway edema. She was
supported with supplemental oxygen and heliox at time. She did
not require NIV or intubation. She was treated with prn nebs,
but no high dose steroids as this was not felt to be consistent
with asthma exacerbation. No clinical evidence of infection. She
was evaluated by PT and cleared for home. She was walked around
the unit and was saturating at 94% on RA. She felt well and safe
to go home. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (her PCP) was called and he felt as though
she was a good judge of being safe to go home.

# Trabeculectomy/Glaucoma: She had her procedure and tolerated
surgery well. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended Tobramycin drops 4
times a day, Tobraymycin oitnment at night, and apraclonidine
[**Hospital1 **] with follow-up early next week.

# Rheumatoid arthritis: Stable. She was continued on imuran.
Humira was to be continued on [**Hospital1 **] weekly.

# Coronary artery disease: Stable. ASA allergy. Continued on
ticlopidine, BB and statin.

# Diabetes type II: Pt denies dx, more likely hyperglycemia that
is steroid related. She was covered with HISS, and [**Hospital1 **]
with diet control.

# Depression and anxiety: Continued on home meds of Abilify,
Duloxetine, and lorazepam.

# Supraventricular tachycardia: Stable. Continued on digoxin,
verapamil, metoprolol

# HTN: Stable during admission. Continued verapamil and
metoprolol.

# Transition issues: She was [**Hospital1 **] home with follow-up
established with Pulmonology, Ophthalmology, and her PCP.
