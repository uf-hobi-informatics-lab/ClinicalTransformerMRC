Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
presyncopal episodes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EP ablation

History of Present Illness:
66yof w/ pmh CAD s/p CABG '[**85**], AAA repair, DM, PVD s/p bilat
AKA, hypoithyroid, hyperlipidemia, CHF, dizziness, chroinic
wounds (healed pressure ulcer on back, red cuts under breasts,
old healing abd wound), presents to OSH [**12-20**] w/ presyncopal
episodes and hypotension that had been on and off for three
days.  She was managed on the floor but tx to CCU [**12-21**] for per
report sustained VT w/ BP 50/.  She was intubated and shocked
x5.  She was started on Procainamide gtt at 3mg/min, Neo gtt and
propofol gtt.  Per report, while pt intubated and sedated, her
she had no VT.  Her last shock was [**12-21**].She was weaned from
sedation and extubated [**12-22**] and her VT re-occurred.  Since then,
she has been in NS/SB 48-52 and has recurrent VT (5-10 beat
runs) w/ BP 80-90/.

She reported presyncopal attacks for 3 days prior to [**Last Name (un) **]
presentation to the OSH. During these episodes, she felt dizzy
and had reduction in her vision. No associated chest pain, [**Doctor Last Name **]
or palpitations. No history of diarrhoea, vomiting or reduced
intake. There had been no recent change in her home medications.
In addition, she reprots that her caregiver noticed dark stool
on day 2 of symptoms, unclear whether melanotic.  Denies any
BRBPR, no nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain.

Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible EP ablation of the focus of
her presumed Vtach. On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, ECG in sinus
revealed RBBB, LAFB, left atrial abnormality. ECG from OSH([**Hospital1 34**])
showed NSVT negative in II, III, F, positive in 1, L, transition
at V3/V4 in setting of SVT possible AT at 260.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2116-12-25**]
Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats. Right
bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular block.
Anterolateral lead ST-T wave abnormalities are primary and are
non-specific. Since the previous tracing of [**2114-4-1**] ventricular
ectopy is present. Otherwise, there is no significant change.
.
- CXR at OSH showed no evidence of pulmonary congestion.
.
- ECG:  ECG in sinus revealed RBBB, LAFB, left atrial
abnormality. ECG from OSH([**Hospital1 34**]) showed NSVT negative in II, III,
F, positive in 1, L, transition at V3/V4 in setting of SVT
possible AT at 260.
.
- ECHO: [**2116-12-21**] at [**Hospital6 33**].  Full report in chart.
 Of note, EF 10-15%.  Severe diffuse hypokinesis.  Akinesis and
aneursymal deformity of apical walls.  Mild mitral
regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation, PASP estimated at
13mmHg + RA pressure.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**2116-12-26**]
1. Diffuse thinning of anterior abdominal musculature with
diffuse bulge of abdomen. Fat containing umbilical hernia.
Multiple gas-filled loops of bowel including the transverse
colon, finding which can be seen in bedbound patients. No bowel
obstruction.
2. Diffusely abnormal abdominal aorta with long-segment fusiform
aneurysm (5 cm), as previously described. Size is similar to
that seen on [**2114-4-1**], however now with increased mural thrombus,
effectively resulting in decreased size of true lumen. Also now
occluded right common iliac artery, with reconstitution of flow
seen at right common femoral artery.
3. Cardiomegaly with left ventricular enlargement and left
ventricular
aneurysm.
4. Possible 3-mm right lower lobe nodule, incompletely imaged.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) 8773**] criteria, if the patient is at high risk for
intrathoracic
malignancy, follow-up CT would be recommended in 1 year.
Otherwise, no
further imaging would be recommended.
5. Multiple renal hypodensities, too small to characterize.
.
TTE [**2116-12-25**]
Poor image quality. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the ventricle. A left
ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded (not seen but poor
visualization of the apex cannot exclude). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-30**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. EF 20-25%.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-4-4**], no
clear change (given LV dysfunciton persists, Takotsubo CM is no
longer on the differential). If indicated, a repeat study with
echo contrast OR a cardiac MRI may better assess LV/RV function
and exclude apical thrombus.

Brief Hospital Course:
66F with CAD s/p CABG [**2085**], HL, PAD s/p B/L AKA in [**2112**] & AAA
endovascular repair [**2104**], hypothyroid, 1 PPD [**Last Name (LF) 1818**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 30-35%
per [**Hospital1 34**] echo [**2114**], obesity, decub ulcer, ventral hernia with
ulceration p/w VT storm to [**Hospital1 34**] now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
possible VT ablation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13177**].
.
#Arrhythmia: SVT with RBBB with intervals of VTach (runs of
between 3 and 18 each time). At least two ectobic sites, one in
the atria causing the SVT and one causing the VT. Probable
causes previous MI, hyper/hypotension, elytes. Pt denies any
CP/SOB/orthopnea. TSH was normal at 1.8. ECG from [**Hospital1 34**] showed
NSVT negative in II, III, F, positive in 1, L, transition at
V3/V4 in setting of SVT possible AT at 260.
ECG on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] in sinus showed RBBB, LAFB, left atrial
abnormality
Pt was started on procainamide gtt at 3, VT initially reduced
but then flared up and gtt was increased to 4, and then DCd
prior to ablation. CCU attending ?????? 60 minutes critical care. Pt
continued to have runs of VT and was taken for ablation. EP lab
transseptal approach to ablate focus in LV, however found
several other foci of VT as well as AT. Given multiple foci not
all of which successfully ablated, decision to treat with
antiarrythmics.  Pt also had a competing atrial tachycardia.
Given procainamide 950mg IV bolus which converted to sinus
(although sinus rhythm difficult to tell from VT - mainly by
rate - VT rate was 130, sinus in 90s) and then transitioned to
amiodarone with procainamide DCd. Pt was monitored but continued
having occasional runs of VT, and plan was to place permanent
pacer. Progressive second degree heart block throughout day
after the procedure with HR transiently dropping to 30s although
BP stable. Resited RIJ to left cordis/ trauma line and placed
temp transvenous pacer. However, she developed septic picture
and permanent hardware was not able to be placed in that setting
(see sepsis, below). Patient had sedation weaned and did not
regain consciousness. In the setting of increasing leukocytosis,
worsening renal failure, anasarca, and acute wound dehiscence at
her groin puncture sites extending deep into the groin tissue,
patient was transitioned to comfort measures only per the wishes
of her family on the morning of [**2116-12-28**]. At 1827 on [**12-28**],
patient expired peacefully of cardiac arrest, with family at
bedside.
.
# Hypotension: Patient's SBP during course of illness ranged
from low of 50s to 90. In the unit the MAPS have been btw 55-70
with SBP of 77-94 and DBP of 48-60. Probable causes are
cardiogenic(previous MI with non-contractile myocardium, SVT/VT,
valvular dxs), hypovolemia, anemia, sepsis, hypothyroidism,
non-compliance to medication). Pt was started on levophed but in
setting of VT/arrythmia with increased ectopy this was changed
to neosynephrine.
.
# CHF: Ptn with previous hx of CAD/MI and CABG.On Ace inh and BB
at home. Probable causes for decompensation include arrythmias,
hypovolemia, anemia. Repeat echo shows decline in EF: [**Month (only) **]/12 -
10-15%, from 30-35% in [**2114**]. Diuresis was attempted with lasix
but was minimally successful. Diuretics then held in setting of
hypotension. ACEI and Bblocker also held in setting of
hypotension.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine 0.8 on [**2116-12-21**], went up to 1.8 on [**2116-12-27**].
Renal assisted in examination of urine sediment and no casts
were seen. Cytology consistent with pre-renal picture (shrunken
RBCs) but no signs of ATN. FeNa was 0.13%.
.
# Sepsis - WBC to 23 on [**2116-12-27**]. Pt still with phenylephrine
pressor requirement, fevers, and intermittently tachycardic. UA
was dirty and there was evidence of skin breakdown around the
areas where pt had vascular access. PT also had history of MRSA
colonization, and was started empirically on vanc/cefepime. -
central line in RIJ was changed over a wire. New line was placed
in LIJ and catheter tip of RIJ was sent for culture. Urine
culture showed no growth. Blood cultures pending at time of
expiration.
.
# Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia. Probably 2/2 blood
loss (dark stool reported), hemolysis or anemia of chronic
illness. Hct down at 31 from 38  five days earlier.
.
# Supratherapeutic INR - pt had INR of 2.5 on presentation (on
warfarin for h/o DVT) which peaked at 4.5 on [**2116-12-26**] even though
coumadin was held after INR was supratherapeutic at 3.5.
.
# Sacral, chest, abdominal, groin wounds: Chronic wounds. Groin
wounds developed secondary to femoral catheterization. Pain
controlled with methadone.
