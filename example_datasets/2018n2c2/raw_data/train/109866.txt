History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 87 years old man, previously relatively
healthy, who developed anorexia and had a 15 lbs weight loss
over the past 6 weeks. He states that he had his last full
"real" meal about 6 weeks ago after which he "lost interest" in
eating. He specifically denies any problems with dysphagia, pain
with eating or swallowing, choking, food getting stuck, early
satiety, nausea or vomiting. He also denies any fevers or
chills, and continues
to have small bowel movements. Over the past 6 weeks he has been
only taking liquids to stay hydrated, no solid food, and has
lost at least 15 lbs as a result. He has a very mild shortness
of breath but in general aside from "not wanting to eat" denies
anything else that is bothering him at present.

He has visited his PCP several times and was finally referred
for admission to [**Hospital **] Hospital due to failure to thrive. He
had a CT today which shows a large left diaphragmatic hernia
with abdominal contents in the left chest, with organo-axial
volvulus. He received zosyn and Protonix 40 at [**Hospital1 **] and was
transferred here for further management of this complex surgical
problem.

[**2130-3-14**] CXR :
Patient's condition required examination in upright sitting
position using AP frontal and left lateral views. The heart
shadow is
difficult to delineate in detail because of overlapping
mediastinal structures including a large left-sided hiatal
hernia. Significant cardiac enlargement is unlikely and the
pulmonary vasculature is not congested. Relative prominence of
the central pulmonary vessels is identified but more attenuated
appearance of the periphery does not demonstrate any evidence of
advanced CHF.
There are some old parenchymal scars in the apical area but no
active
abnormalities are seen. Bilaterally, the lateral pleural spaces
are blunted probably by pleural effusions mild-to-moderate
degree. There is a large sized hiatal hernia with typical
air-fluid level in retrocardiac position. No other pulmonary or
cardiovascular abnormalities can be identified. Our records do
not include previous chest examinations available for
comparison. An outside chest CT has been transferred in to our
PACS system and shows the presence of a large hiatal hernia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital, kept NPO and hydrated
with IV fluids. Based on his symptoms and anatomy, repair of his
large paraesophageal hernia was recommended.  Unfortunately he
became delirious after having low dose Ativan which was given
preoperatively to reduce his anxiety.  He was taken to the
Operating Room for surgery on [**2130-3-15**] but immediately refused
the surgery when he arrived in the Operating Room. He appeared
confused and delirious, the surgery was cancelled and he
returned to the floor.

The Psychiatry service evaluated him and felt that the confusion
and delirium was prompted by Ativan in combination with poor
nutritional status and his age. At that point the patient wanted
surgery again.  A decision was made to place a PICC line and
give TPN for 4-5 days prior to operating with the attempt to
help improve his nutritional status.  A PICC line was placed on
[**2130-3-16**] and TPN began.

In the mean time he worked with Physical Therapy and had no more
episodes of confusion or delirium.

On [**2130-3-20**] he was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a
laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair with PEG tube
placement. He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the
PACU in stable condition.  He maintained stable hemodynamics and
his pain was well controlled.  Following transfer to the
Surgical floor he continued to make good progress.  His pain was
controlled with Tylenol alone and his mental status was intact.
His TPN continued and eventually tube feedings were started and
well tolerated.  He was maintained on 2 cal HN 1 can TID.  His
TPN was weaned off [**2130-3-23**] and his PICC line was removed.

His chest xray on admission to the hospital was notable for
bilateral pleural effusions but his respiratory status was not
compromised.  His effusions did increase in size and on [**2130-3-23**]
he has a left thoracentesis for 1 liter of serosanguinous fluid.
 He tolerated it well and his subsequent chest xray demonstrated
no pneumothorax and a clear diaphram.  He was breathing
comfortably off of oxygen and had room air saturations of 95%.

He continued to work with Physical Therapy who recommended that
he go to a short term rehab prior to returning home to increase
his mobility and endurance.  From a surgical standpoint he
continued to do well.  His post sites were healing well and his
PEG site was dry.  After a long hospital stay he was discharged
to rehab on [**2130-3-24**].
