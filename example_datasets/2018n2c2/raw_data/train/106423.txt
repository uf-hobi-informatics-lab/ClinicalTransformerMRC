                            **FINAL REPORT [**2178-6-30**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2178-6-30**]):    NO GROWTH.

CXR: FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were
obtained.  The heart is of normal size with normal
cardiomediastinal contours.  Bilateral streaky linear perihilar
opacities are compatible with reactive airway disease,
progressed since [**2175**] and similar to [**2178-5-16**].  The lungs
are otherwise clear.  No lobar consolidation, pleural effusion,
or pneumothorax.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.  No
radiopaque foreign bodies.
IMPRESSION:  Bilateral streaky perihilar opacities, compatible
with reactive airway disease, similar to [**2178-5-16**] though
progressed since [**2176-9-13**].


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with an exacerbation of his
reactive airway disease, asthma vs COPD vs bronchiectasis. He
was started on standing bronchodilator nebs and prednisone 60mg
daily and admitted to the ICU. His CXR showed no PNA. His
respiratory status improved dramatically in the next 24h and his
oxygen sat was 97% RA with ambulation. He was encouraged to quit
smoking again and provided script for nicotine lozenges. He was
discharged with a plan to taper prednisone in the following
manner: take 60mg x 4 days, 50mg x 4 days, 40mg x 4 days, then
return to usual dose of 30mg daily. He should likely have a high
res CT chest as an outpatient to eval for bronchiectasis. He may
also have an element of COPD contributing to this picture. He
will follow up with PCP in next few days, pulmonary next month.
