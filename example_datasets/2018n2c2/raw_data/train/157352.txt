Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea and LE edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
62 year old male with chief complaint of shortness of breath,
increased leg swelling for the last several weeks as well as
diarrhea and abdominal pain. He has had dyspnea on exertion and
orthopnea for 2.5 months and increasing lower extremities edema
x3 weeks. No previous history of LE edema. He was previously on
HCTZ 25mg daily but this was stopped ~2.5 months ago because his
physician felt he was getting dehydrated.
.
He also has chronic abdominal pain and diarrhea as well as a 60
lbs weight loss. In [**Month (only) **] he was diagnosed with Crohn's
disease (had a colonoscopy in [**Location (un) 7349**]). He has also had multiple
anal abscess that need to be drained.
.
In the ED his initial VS were: T 98.7 P 100 BP 120/74 R O2 sat
86/ra. He was briefly hypoxic to the 80s. He was also noted to
have diffuse abdominal tenderness. A CT was performed given his
past history of abdominal abscesses which was negative for any
acute infection, however a CXR showed
.
He was given 40mg IV lasix and put out ~1.5L with some
improvement in his oxygenation. He was also given 750mg Levoquin
and 500mg Flagyl with concern for an aspiration PNA followed by
a 1gm of CTX. Given his overall degree of hypoxia he was
admitted to the ICU for further management. At the time of
transfer he was breathing 95% on a venti face mask.
.
On arrival in the ICU he was in mild respiratory distress,
otherwise hemodynamically stable, and alert and oriented x3.

   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2188-12-13**]):
      <10 PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper
respiratory
      secretions. Bacterial culture results are invalid.
      PLEASE SUBMIT ANOTHER SPECIMEN.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2188-12-13**]):
      TEST CANCELLED, PATIENT CREDITED.

   Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)
(Final
      [**2188-12-15**]):
      POSITIVE FOR PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECII (CARINII).
.
CXR (Portable AP) [**2188-12-12**]:
FINDINGS: AP portable upright view of the chest is obtained.
Diffuse parenchymal opacities are noted which are more notable
in the lower lungs.  The overall appearance is suggestive of
pulmonary edema though the possibility of pneumonia cannot be
entirely excluded. Given the relative sparing of the upper
lungs, the possibility of underlying emphysema is considered. No
large pleural effusions or definite sign of pneumothorax is
seen. A rounded structure projects over the right mid lung which
is likely external to the patient. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is normal. Bones appear intact.

IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of pulmonary edema, though
cannot exclude
pneumonia.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2188-12-12**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute CT findings in the abdomen or pelvis.
2. Ground-glass opacities in both lungs may represent pulmonary
edema,
inflammatory and/or infectious disease.
3. Fatty infiltration of the submucosa of the ascending [**Month/Day/Year 499**],
cecum, and
terminal ileum compatible with history of Crohn's disease. No
evidence of
acute Crohn's flare.
.
TTE [**2188-12-13**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with probable mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid
inferior septum. Due to suboptimal technical quality, other
focal wall motion abnormalities cannot be fully excluded. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.


IMPRESSION: poor technical quality. The basal to mid inferior
septum is probably hypokinetic, other focal wall motion
abnormalityies cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is
not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
.
CT Chest [**2188-12-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No findings of interstitial lung disease. Progressive diffuse
ground
glass pulmonary opacities in conjunction with more solid
peribronchiolar
consolidation within the lower lobes. The findings are most
suggestive of
infection with the differential including PJP, viral (CMV), and
bacterial.  Other possibility includes diffuse alveolar
damage/ARDS.
2. Interval development of peripancreatic fluid tracking into
the left
pararenal space suggestive of acute pancreatitis.
3. Fatty infiltration of the liver.
.
RUQ ultrasound [**2188-12-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
2. No peripancreatic fluid collection.
3. Echogenic liver compatible with fatty infiltration. Other
forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be
excluded on the basis of imaging.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course
62M Crohn's dz presented with worsening dyspnea, orthopnea and
lower extremity edema as well as diarrhea and weight loss.
.
# Dyspnea/PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] presented with dyspnea with mild cough,
orthopnea and lower extremity edema and had oxygen saturations
in the low 90s on a 60% venturi mask. Chest imaging did not show
any focal process but was concerning for either fluid overload
or an inflammatory process. A BNP was ~200. He was initially
diuresed for suspected CHF exacerbation and started on
levo/flagyl (later ceftriaxone, azithromycin, flagyl) for
possible pneumonia. He failed to improve on diuretics and
antibiotics. An echo showed no evidence of significant systolic
dysfunction (EF 50%). On the second day of hospitalization
sputem cultures showed PCP and he was started on IV bactrim and
IV steroids. His oxygen requirement significantly improved over
the next two days and he had oxygen saturations ~95% on 3L NC at
the time of transfer to the floor. On medicine floor, pt
continued to improved; O2 sat requirement decreased and was able
to take POs. Pt discharged to rehab to complete course of abx
(PO bactrim DS 3 tabs TID, 21 days [**Date range (1) 88033**] per ID) and
recovery.
.
# HIV/AIDS: Diagnosed this admission with HIV viral load of
489,000, CD4 of 10 and OI as above. ID consult was obtained for
management of PCP in [**Name Initial (PRE) **] newly diagnosed HIV patient and it was
agreed to continue with IV bactrim and steroids (3wk course,
switched to PO prednisone on [**2188-12-21**] at 40mg x5days the 20mg
prednisone x11days). HAART therapy was not initiated at this
time in the setting of acute PCP infection and concern for
immune reconstitution. Arrangements were made for outpatient
follow up with ID (see discharge plan information). Details of
acquisition not discussed in detail but per patient he thinks
likely within past 6 months. Please note that his family and HCP
(his superior) do not know; at this point, pt is not ready to
tell them. As pt was able to tolerate POs, both meds and food,
and began having more normal BMs, pt was transitioned to PO
bactrim per ID to complete his course of abx.
.
# Acute Pancreatitis: Likely drug-induced, possibly from lasix
initially given with concern for CHF. Initially asymptomatic,
found by chest CT which peripancreatic fluid tracking into left
pararenal space. Lipase was noted to be elevated at 1446 and
amylase at 455. RUQ ultrasound showed fatty infiltration of
liver but otherwise no biliary ductal dilatation and no
peripancreatic fluid collection. Treated with bowel rest and
IVF. Lipase rapidly resolved. Pt was then able to advance diet
and take POs.
.
# Crohn's: dx in [**Location (un) 7349**] by colonoscopy ~9 months prior to
admission. Previously treated with Asacol but stopped due to
poor toleration. On bunetinide oral steroids at time of
admission in addition to PO cipro and flagyl which was started
~3 months prior to admission for bloody diarrhea with good
results (these were all stopped and NOT restarted at discharge).
Evaluated by GI in house and felt appropriate for outpatient
follow up. However, given HIV status, ID was concerned that a
diagnosis of Crohn's so late in life was unusually and felt that
another OI may be the cause given pt's CD4 was 10. CMV and LGV
were both negative. ID and PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] scheduled, will arrange
GI follow-up as other issues are address and concern for other
OI ruled out.
.
Pt was full code during admission.
Pt was transferred to rehab facility to complete his recover. He
will follow-up with ID; pt will arrange GI follow-up at a later
date as an outpt.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you were found to have
worsening shortness of breath, leg swelling, fever, diarrhea and
weight loss. Becuase your condition was very grave, you were
admitted to the ICU for care. Inititally, there was concern that
you had heart failure and you received medications that helped
to remove the excess fluid from your body that was contributing
to your worsening respiratory status. Later it was determined
that you had a very serious pneumonia and that you were
immunocompromised. You required significant supplemental oxygen
to help you keep the level of oxygen in your blood at a safe
level. You were started on IV antibiotics. Initially, you had
difficulting taking anything by mouth because of severe nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea; this was improved by bowel rest, IV
medication and supportive care. You continued to improve and
were able to be transferred out of the ICU to the regular
medicine floor. You supplemenatly oxygen needs decreased and
your respiratory status improved. As your diarrhea, nausea and
vomitting had subsided and you were able to take food and
medicine effectively by mouth. You were then able to be
discharge to a rehabilitation facility to complete your
recovery.
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
- Please START taking Bactrim DS 3tabs three times a day to
complete a 21 day course started on [**12-15**] and ending on [**1-5**].
You will likely need to remain on a lower dose of Bactrim after
you complete the current course; this lower dose will help to
prevent future pneumonias of the same type. Please be sure to
discuss this with your doctors.
- Please START taking prednisone 40mg PO daily for 5 days
(started on [**2188-12-20**] to end on [**2188-12-25**]), follwoed by 20mg
prednisone daily for an additional 11 days for a total of 3 wk
course to end on [**1-5**].
- Please START taking Azithromycin 1200 mg PO/NG 1X/WEEK (every
FRIDAY)
- Please START taking Pantoprazole 40 mg PO daily
- Please STOP taking Ethenocort, Hydrochlorothiazide,
Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl. The need for these medication should
be discussed with your doctors as [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] or may not need to
restart them or a different medication may be prescribed.
Please be sure to take all medication as prescribed.
.
Also, you will need to have weekly blood labs performed to
follow your red blood cell count given your anemia. This will be
important for management and treatment purposes. Please discuss
this with your docotrs.
.
Please be sure to keep all follow-up appointments with your PCP
and other healthcare providers.
.
It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you a speedy
recovery.
