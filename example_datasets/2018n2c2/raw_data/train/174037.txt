Chief Complaint:
transfer for management of pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line
Arterial line

History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 61 year-old female with a history of EtOH abuse,
cholelithiasis s/p cholecystectomy, who presents from an OSH
with likely acute pancreatitis.
.
Pt was initially admitted to the OSH [**Date range (1) 29693**] for two
episodes of epigastric pain and abnormal LFTs (AST 466 ALT 268).
US and MRCP were reportedly normal. She was discharged with
diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis. That evening, pt called her GI
doctor complaining of severe abdominal pain, n/v, tremulousness.
She presented to the ED and was re-admitted. She was noted to be
jaundiced, groggy, with a protuberant abdomen. WBC was 13.8, K
2.8, Bili 7.7, AST 324, ALT 370, alk phos 251, lipast 4877. Tox
screen and EtOH levels were negative. Her abdomen became
distended, tense, very tender, with no bowel sounds. She was
transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring. She was treated
with IVF and aggressive pain control with dilaudid 1mg IV q3.
Additionally she was sedated on precedex and an ativan drip at
4mg/h. Pt was intubated for airway protection on the morning of
[**10-14**]. CT of the abdomen revealed enlarged indistinct pancreas,
extensive peripancreatic fluid consistent with severe
pancreatitis and pancreatic necrosis, no loculated or drainable
fluid collections or evidence of perforation. Also noted were
small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate amount of free
fluid in the deep pelvis.
.

Pertinent Results:
==========
Radiology/Neurology
==========
MRCP [**10-16**]
1. Necrotozing, hemorrhagic pancreatitis involving majority of
the body and
tail and portions of the head and neck. Small portion of
enhancing pancreatic
tissue remains in the distal tail and portions of the head.
There is no
pancreatic ductal dilatation, however, a portion in the region
of the genu is
attenuated but not disrupted at this time.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions and small-to-moderate
ascites.
3. The portal vein, SMV, and SMA are patent. Note is made

CT Head [**10-16**]
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhages, edema,
masses, mass
effect, or large area of infarction. The lateral ventricles are
slightly
prominent for age and represent mild volume loss. The sulci are
normal in
caliber and configuration. There is no evidence of bony
fracture.

EEG [**10-17**]
Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the moderately severe
suppression of the background throughout. The background was
slow, and
it was intermittent, alternating with much lower voltage
patterns.
There was a brief episode of some "lightening," but the
background
remained encephalopathic throughout. Medication effect is
probably the
most common cause of such recordings. There were no areas of
prominent
focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There
were no epileptiform features.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**10-18**]
No intracranial abnormalities detected. Specifically, no
evidence of hemorrhage or infarction. Incidentally noted adipose
accumulation
over the right malar eminence and right maxillary sinus
air-fluid level.

CT A/p [**10-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe pancreatitis with extensive pancreatic necrosis
sparing portions of
the head and tail.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increased.
3. Marked narrowing of the splenic vein and possible non-
occlusive thrombus
within its mid portion.
4. Peripancreatic phlegmon and free fluid in pelvis.


TTE [**10-19**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The estimated
cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). There is a mild resting
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to increased stroke
volume due to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen
on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No valvular vegetations
identified, but cannot definitively exclude given poor acoustic
windows. Hyperdynamic left ventricular function with resting
tachycardia. Normal left ventricular systolic function.
Technically suboptimal to exclude focal wall motion abnormality.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension

CT Chest [**10-23**]
1. Multifocal patchy areas of consolidation may reflect an
infectious
process.
2. Moderate pulmonary edema including moderate pleural
effusions, slightly
smaller compared to the recent abdominal CT.
3. 2.3-cm spiculated right right lobe nodule is worrisome for
malignancy. for
which short interval followup, after patient's acute symptoms
resolved, is
recommended.
4. Anasarca.
5. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis, incompletely assessed.

CT Chest [**10-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Interval worsening of multifocal areas of consolidation,
probably
reflecting an ongoing infectious process.
3. Moderate pulmonary edema with slightly increased moderate
pleural
effusions bilaterally.
4. 8-mm right lower lobe opacity, smaller compared to the
previously seen 2.3
cm spiculated right lower lobe nodule and probably represents
atelectasis
versus consolidation. A chest CT following resolution of
patient's acute
symptoms is again advised.
5. Anasarca.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Acute severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis: Lipase was elevated to
4788 at the OSH. OSH CT showed pancreatitis and concern for
pancreatic necrosis. EtOH pancreatitis is the most likely
etiology. She underwent MRCP at our hospital which demonstrated
hemorrhagic, necrotic pancreatitis. Patient was managed
conservatively with aggressive fluid replacement. A surgery
consult was obtained and did not advise any operative or IR
procedures for the peripancreatic inflammation. She subsequently
developed acute lung injury, bilat pleural effusions,
anasarca,and ascites as a result of the severe pancreatitis. Her
course was complicated by vent associated pneumonia as well. She
also showed altered mental status during her ICU stay related to
toxic and metabolic encephalopathy. Patient required insulin
replacement therapy while she was in the unit and on the floor.
She was then transferred from the ICU to the floor. There, she
had PT/OT, blood transfusion for anemia from hemorrhagic
pancreatitis, and diuresis. Before transfer to rehab she was
noted to have significant and had CXR. This showed possible
loculated left upper lobe effusion. She underwent repeat CT of
the chest on [**2164-11-2**] which showed moderate bilateral pleural
effusions and anterior loculated left pleural effusion.  Case
was discussed with interventional pulmonary service and given
the patient's improving clinical status and lack of active
evidence of infection, they recommended not performing a
paracentesis to evaluate the loculated effusion.  The patient
was educated to return if she develops fevers, rigors, sweats,
worsening difficulty breathing.
.
# Altered mental status: Her mental status was altered and
related to toxic and metabolic encephalopathy. Head imaging was
negative (CT and MRI)including EEG. She is back to normal mental
functioning after her prolonged and complicated course.
.
# VAP: Sputum grew MSSA (imipenem sensitive). She was initially
on Vancomycin and imipenem. Vancomycin d/ced ([**Date range (1) 82010**]). She
was transition ed from Imipenem ([**10-16**] ?????? [**10-22**]) to Nafcillin on
[**10-22**], but Imipenem was restarted again given decompensating
respiratory status. CT chest on [**10-26**] was concerning for
worsening multifocal pneumonia, so her antibiotics were changed
from Imipenem to Vanco/Zosyn. Microbiology data has been
negative since [**10-17**]. 14 day course of antibiotics were completed
on [**10-30**]. Cough improved with expectorant and mucous clearing
device. Before transfer to rehab she was noted to have
significant and had CXR. This showed possible loculated left
upper lobe effusion. She underwent repeat CT of the chest on
[**2164-11-2**] which showed left anterior loculated effusion.
.
# Pulmonary edema/Acute lung injury:  Extubated [**10-21**] but
emergently re-intubated [**10-23**] during event with SVT and
hypotension. Patient was extubated again [**10-25**]. CT chest showed
interstitial changes and pleural effusions. Bronchoscopy on [**10-17**]
was WNL, and samples significant only for 2+ polys and staph
aureus. She continued to receive to Lasix with effective
diuresis.
.
# SVT: Patient has prior h/o of Afib. Reportedly never
anticoagulated. Episodes of SVT appear to be precipitated by
diuresis. She was emergently re intubated on [**10-23**] during episode
of SVT with hypotension that did not respond to electrical
cardioversion. Patient was loaded on amiodarone and remained in
NSR thereafter. CTA was negative for PE. She was then placed on
maintenance dose of 200 mg /day. Patient was also continued on
home dose of metoprolol.
.
# Horase voice: patient had traumatic intubation and continues
to have a hoarse voice. ENT reports vocal cords functional and
will continue to take time to recover.
Plan for pt to f/u with ENT in 2 wks after discharge.
.
# RLL nodule ?????? RLL nodule appreciated on Chest CT. This will
require outpatient follow up in 10 - 30 days after discharge.
PCP was notified on [**2164-11-2**].
.
# Nasal skin necrosis possibly related to her ICU stay. She was
seen by plastic surgery on [**2164-11-2**]. The necrosis is not
infected. They recommended local care and out patient follow up
at their resident clinic.
