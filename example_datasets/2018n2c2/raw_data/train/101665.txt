Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers, abdominal pain, diarrhea, cough


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 39 year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy,
chronic aspiration, GERD, ? ulcerative colitis who presents with
low grade temps at home, cough, abdominal pain.  He is
accompanied by his mother.  [**Name (NI) **] had a colonoscopy on [**3-17**] to
evaluate for IBD, with fairly normal appearing bowel but
biopsies are pending.  Afterwards, he was constipated, but then
started have very loose stools yesterday and today.  He has had
low grade temps, about 100 at home.  Also, his mother states his
cough seems to be worse lately.  He has also been complaining of
abdominal pain as well.  He gets his nutrition via his G-tube at
home.  Also of note, he recently completed a course of
azithromycin for a skin boil.
.
In the ED, inital vitals were 101.2, 140, 113/79, 28, 92%RA.  He
was given a total of 3L IVFs in the ED with  improvement of his
tachycardia.  He was also given morphine and zofran in the ED.
Subsequently, his SBP dropped to the 80s and high 70s, and was
not improving with IVFs.  He was started on peripheral dopamine.
 There were lengthy discussions with the family regarding a
central line, but they did not want one at this time.  His CXR
was concerning for a LLL consolidation.  He underwent CT
abdomen/pelvis which did not show any specific findings, but did
show some inflammation of the rectum and ? prostatitis.  Rectal
exam did not show e/o tenderness of his prostate. He was given
vancomycin, flagyl, and gentamicin in the ED.  He has multiple
abx allergies. He was then transferred to the ICU for further
monitoring.
.
ROS: the patient has limited communication at baseline.  Denies
pain at this time.


Past Medical History:
-Cerebral Palsy
-Chronic Aspiration
-Gastroesophageal reflux disease
-? Ulcerative Colitis- currently undergoing workup
-Seizure disorder

Social History:
Lives at home with his parents who provide his care. He is
wheelchair bouns and non verbal at baseline. He receives
nutrition through a G-tube, though he can take certain liquid
medications by mouth. He has a personal care assistant at home
who also helps with his care. No tobacco, ETOH or illicit drug
use.

and lower extremities. Patellar DTR +1. Plantar reflex
downgoing. No gait disturbance. No cerebellar dysfunction.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis. No ecchymoses.


Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CXR:  IMPRESSION: Hazy subtle opacity within the left lung base,
which could represent early pneumonia.
.
[**3-21**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is apparent mild rectal
thickening, which may relate to recent instrumentation or be
inflammatory in nature. A slightly  edematous appearance of the
prostate and seminal vesicles is again seen, but of unclear
etiology. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Bilateral fat and fluid-containing inguinal hernias are
identified. Osseous structures demonstrate a right convex
curvature of the lumbosacral spine. There are bilateral pars
defects of the L5 vertebral body, without evidence of antero- or
retrolisthesis. There are apparent undescended or high-riding
testicles, for which non-urgent scrotal ultrasound should be
consisdered.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of perforation or abscess.
2. Mild rectal thickening may be inflammatory or post-procedural
in nature.
3. Consider non-urgent scrotal ultrasound.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 39 year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy,
chronic aspiration, GERD who presents with fevers, cough,
abdominal pain, and diarrhea with persistent hypotension.
.
Plan:
# Hypotension - on initial admit, febrile, tachycardic, and had
leukocytosis.  Potential likely sources included LLL pneumonia
with infiltrate on CXR, c.diff given diarrhea and recent abx
exposure.  Other possible causes are prostate though no specific
findings on exam. urine clear. no clear reason to suspect
meningitis (no neck stiffness than baseline per mother).  GI was
consulted.  Family deferred CVL; team discussed risks of
dopamine peripherally.  Dopamine was initially given for ~10
hours to maintian MAPs>60.  Pt was initially treated for
possible aspiration pna and cdiff with vanco, gentamicin, and
flagyl.  On hospital day #2, gentamicin and vancomycin were
discontinued and flaygl was continued as the infiltrates on cxr
were not felt to be the active site of infection.  Patient did
not have evidence of c.diff and was discontinued.  The patient
clinically improved and was discharged home on loperamide.
.
# Hypotension: as above, thought likely component of
dehydration, medication effect from meds given in the ED and
infection.  Pt was treated with IVF and initially with dopamine.
 Hemodynamics were stabilized.
.
# Abd pain/gerd:  CT scan ruled out acute pathology, suggested
duodenitis.  CXR suggested possible chronic aspiration.  Pt
remained on his at-home PPI and H2 blocker.  He was restarted on
his TFs via G-tube on hospital day #2.
.
# Seizure d/o: continued home phenobarb and diazepam
.
