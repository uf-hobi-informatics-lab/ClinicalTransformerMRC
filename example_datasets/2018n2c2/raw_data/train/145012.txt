None


History of Present Illness:
60 yo male, h/o 5V CABG, CHF, BIV ICD/PPM, who found by his
wife, sitting in chair with heated blanket, looking pale and
with difficulty speaking. He then appeared not to be breathing.
She called EMS, CPR briefly initiated(1-2 min) No tonic-clonic
movements, but + incontinence of urine. EMS reported a weak
pulse, but could not get a good BP. Got small amount fluid in
the field and then improved.
.
In the ED, initial vital: T 100 rectal, HR 95, BP 113/83, RR 13,
100% NRB. He was noted to be confused with poor short term
memory. CT head negative for acute process. Labs notable for WBC
of 15K, no left shift, TropT 0.04, INR 1.5. Digoxin 1.8, Lactate
1.8. ECG V-paced. Urine and serum tox screens negative, U/A
negative. Got 2L NS, 1gm CTX and 1 gm vancomycin emperically.
Had swelling of LLE> [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] CTA performed which was negative.
Later, family reported that this is his baseline. He was seen by
neuro who found he had inability to form new short term
memories, consistent with b/l hippocampi injury, possibly from
anoxic injury. It was felt that the situation was more
consistent with a cardiac event, and he was admitted to the ICU
for monitoring and work up. Vitals upon transfer: T 98.8, HR 83,
BP 104/90, RR 17, 100% 2L.

STUDIES:
[**2158-12-15**] - CT HEAD -IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
[**2158-12-15**] - CTA CHEST
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Marked cardiomegaly, with evidence of prior myocardial
infarction in the left ventricular apex, with likely areas of
scarring, and aneurysm formation at the apex. Evaluation is
limited on this non-gated study, but a dedicated cardiac CT
could be performed if clinically indicated to further evaluate
this region.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
5. Pulmonary artery enlargement, concerning for pulmonary
arterial
hypertension.
.
[**2158-12-16**] - ECHOCARDIOGRAM
Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to muliple areas of severe
hypokinesis and akinesis (see figure), with posterobasal
dyskinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV
(severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2155-3-17**], the tricuspid
regurgitation is probably increased. Left ventricular
contractile function remains profoundly depressed.
.
[**2158-12-16**] - Left Foot
Three views of the left foot were brought to our review. There
is
irregularity and thickening of the distal portion of the fifth
metatarsal that might represent chronic old fracture. There is
additional irregularity and potential old healed fracture of the
distal second metatarsal.
There is lysis/fracture of the distal part of the proximal third
phalanx with potentially some degree of the subcutaneous air. In
the absence of prior studies for comparison, the chronicity of
these findings cannot be determined.
There is dislocation of the third metatarsophalangeal joint,
chronicity is
also undetermined. If clinically warranted, further evaluation
with MR, more sensitive study for osteomyelitis.
.
[**2158-12-18**] - ART EXT (REST ONLY)
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity ischemia at
rest. Mild left lower extremity peripheral [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] disease with
predominant SFA/tibial location.
.
[**2158-12-20**] - VENOUS ULTRASOUND (MAP)
IMPRESSION: Patent right greater saphenous and bilateral lesser
saphenous
veins with reasonable diameters for bypass.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Unresponsiveness/VTACH - 61 y.o. man with significant cardiac
history who became acutely unresponsive at home. CPR initiated,
had BP and pulse by the time EMS arrived. Confused in ED, CT
scan of the head was unrevealing.  Neuro consulted in the ED and
they felt unlikely to be primary neuro issue. No PE or
pneumothorax on CTA.  The patient was ROMI.  The patient was
admitted to MICU for hypotension and monitoring overnight.  The
EP Cardiology team was consulted and they found 6 minutes of
spontaneous VT occurring precisely at 7PM on the night of
admission after interrogating his pacer.  His device was not
programmed to fire for this particular arrhythmia.  His device
was reprogrammed. The patient had no further significant
arrhythmic events during this admission.  He was noted to have
anterograde amnesia after his arrest which most likely related
to transient ischemia in the brain.  The patient will require
follow up with behavioral neurology.
.
# Osteomyelitis - The patient had a chronic left LE ulceration
related to a hospitalization several years ago.  It looked
erythematous and had purulent drainage on admission.  Podiatry
was consulted for deep tracking foot ulcer on left plantar
surface. Podiatry ecommended broad spectrum antibiotics.  A foot
xray was consistent with osteomyelitis.  Non-invasive arterial
studies were obtained to evaluate the blood flow to his LE prior
to an debridement.  The patient had poor arterial blood flow in
his left LE and [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] surgery was consulted and they
recommended
angiography and possible revascularization procedure in the next
week.  He was discharged on Linezolid and Ciprofloxacin.  He has
close follow up arranged with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1106**] surgery and
podiatry.
.
# CHF, systolic.  His last EF 25%. He appeared clinically
euvolemic.  His digoxin and sotalol were continued.  His
diuretics (lasix and spironolactone) were restarted at lower
doses given the patient's renal function. Echocardiogram was
preformed during this admission.
.
# Renal Function - The patient's creatinine began to rise during
this admission most which was felt to be secondary to vancomycin
toxicity.  The patients diuretics were held.  He was not
pre-renal by labs or volume-depleted on exam.  There was not
evidence of AIN, ATN or renal obstruction.  His creatinine
improved after the vancomycin was discontinued.
.
# The patient's stable medical issues include: Hypothyroidism,
Hyperlipidemi, Anxiety, Insomnia,
.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after an episode of syncope (loss of
consciousness).  The cause of your syncope was an arrhythmia
called Ventricular Tachycardia.  Your pacemaker was reprogrammed
so that it would fire for this particular heart rhythm.  You did
not have any more repeat episodes of syncope.  You were found to
have difficulties with short term memory after this incident and
will need follow up with Behavioral Neurology.
.
You were found to have an infection in the skin and bone of your
left foot.  You will need to take antibiotics for at least the
next 2 weeks.  You will need to follow up with [**Hospital 1106**] surgery
to revasularize your leg prior to having more a surgery to
remove the infected tissue in your foot.  The antibiotic you are
taking for your foot infection, linezolid, can cause your white
blood cell count to be low.  You will need weekly blood draws
while you are on it to check your cell count.
.
You had some worsening renal function likely secondary to
vancomycin an antibiotic you were taking for your infection.
You will need to have your blood drawn on Monday [**12-25**] to have
your renal function checked.
.
We made the following changes to your medication regimen
We decreased the dose of your digxoin, lasix and spironolactone.
 You will be given new prescriptions for those medications.   If
you become more short of breath or notice increased weight or
lower extremity swelling, please call your cardiologist.
We added Ciprofloxacin and Linezolid, 2 antibiotics for your
foot infection, you should take twice daily.
