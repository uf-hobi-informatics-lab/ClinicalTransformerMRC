Chief Complaint:
seizures, concern for status epilepticus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and subsequent extubation

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old right handed woman with a history
of seizures, leukodystrophy, dementia, feeding tube, presenting
as a transfer from [**Hospital6 **] for status epilepticus.
 This history was taken over the phone from her Daughter;
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25807**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 25808**].  She lives at home with her
and the patients husband who are her primary care givers.  She
is bedbound at baseline with quadraparesis with prominent
rightsided weakness.  This morning she was scheduled to see IR
today to have G tube replace at 3 pm.  This morning she had a
questionable small seizure with non responsiveness and quivering
of her lips but it was short lived.  Daughter; felt she had a
low grade temp and a mild cough, but no overt illness. On the
way to [**Hospital3 9717**] she went into a generalized tonic clonic seizure at 2:30
pm with was refractory to 5 mg of ativan, she was intubated at
3:30 for airway protection and was given a paralytic so it was
unclear if she was still seizing.  They got a head ct and
transferred her to [**Hospital1 **] for further management.

lidocaine 70 mg IV x 1
Fentanyl 120 mcg IV x 1
Rocuronium 36 mg IV x 1
Propofol gtt 10 mg / kg/ min
Zosyn 3.375 g IV x 1 sq

As far as her seizure history, they have been fairly well
controlled on Dilantin, with her lat seizure being months ago.
They are often generalized and recover her to come to the
emergency room.  Seizure began around the beginning of her
mental decline and discovery of her leukodystrophy back in 99,
she did have one seizure requiring intubation at that time.
Regarding
her Leukodystrophy, she had genetic testing at [**Hospital1 2025**] and [**Last Name (un) 18355**]
School, she was tested for common for leukodystrophies and "they
all came up negative." But cognitive decline started in 99 with
slurred speech and weakness on one side, and wasn't sure if it
was MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 25809**] and then had as seizure, has continued to
decline and has been bedbound for about 6 years.  Currently, her
neurologic baseline is that she has some movement of limbs,
weaker on right side; does move a little bit, but not much, she
fidgets a lot with her hands, rips blankets off and tips.

disease and atrophy.

CXR [**2139-6-3**]:
FINDINGS:  AP portable supine chest radiograph obtained.  The
endotracheal
tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 3.4 cm above
the carina.  The NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen.
Contrast is seen within large bowel loops in the right upper
quadrant.  Linear areas of plate-like
atelectasis in the right and left lower lungs are noted.  There
is no large consolidation or signs of CHF.  No definite
pneumothorax is present.  The heart and mediastinal contours
appear grossly unremarkable aside from atherosclerotic
calcifications of the aortic knob.  No definite displaced rib
fractures are seen.
IMPRESSION:  Appropriately positioned endotracheal and
nasogastric tubes.

CXR [**2139-6-4**]:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the
endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged
position.  There is unchanged mild elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm.  The pre-existing right basal
atelectasis is improved.  Retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  No newly appeared
focal parenchymal opacities.


Brief Hospital Course:
64-year-old right handed woman with a history of seizures,
leukodystrophy, dementia, and G tube placement who presented as
a transfer from [**Hospital6 **] for status epilepticus.
She had a GTC yesterday afternoon which was refractory to 5mg of
ativan and was subsequently intubated and paralyzed. Head CT
showed severe chronic small vessel disease and atrophy but no
acute intracranial process. Upon transfer she was continuing to
have some intermittent rhythmic movements of the left hand. She
was admitted to the neuro ICU for close monitoring.

ICU and Hospital course:

#Neuro: She was continued on her home Dilantin as well as a
propofol drip overnight and had no further evidence of seizure
activity. She was maintained on continuous EEG monitoring which
showed L sided slowing with polymorphic delta compared with R
sided theta but no epileptiform activity. She was extubated in
the am of [**6-4**] and quickly returned to her baseline, able to
answer simple questions appropriately and follow basic commands.
Dilantin level was 15.4. She received an extra 200mg dilantin on
[**6-4**] and her home dose was increased to 100mgQAM/200QPM 5x/wk
rather than 4x/wk, with 100mg [**Hospital1 **] 2x/wk.

Etiology of her seizure is somewhat unclear at this point.
Infectious w/u has been negative thus far; it is possible she
could have had an underlying low grade viral URI given her
recent hx of cough. Labs unremarkable except for leukocytosis
which is now downtrending.

The patient was transferred to the floor in good condition. The
patient was extubated the day after admission and did well over
the weekend, however on [**6-8**] the patient spiked a temp and was
found to have a white count of 19 (see below). She began having
more seizures that responded acutely to ativan. She was
frequently somnolent following the seizures - which had a unique
semiology, including rather purposeful picking at covers and
items real and imagined on her bed, waving her hand in the air
as if being attacked by flies, and looking off into the corner
of the room, often up and to the left.

She received several boluses of Dilantin and her dose was
increased to 300 mg total daily. A steady level was difficult to
obtain and she was switched to infatabs that could be crushed
and administered via g-tube. The patient tolerated this
transition well with improved level. Her medications and
seizures were discussed with her daughter and husband who care
for her, as well as her primary doctor who has been managing her
dilantin. Plan was made to continue at 300 mg total daily with
plans to recheck the level in the week following discharge. The
patient did generally well through the rest of her
hospitalization with a single seizure the day prior to discharge
for which she received an extra dose of dilantin with a level up
to 14.4 on discharge.

# Infectious disease: She initially had some low grade fevers
with a Tmax of 100.3. UA and CXR were unremarkable. Blood
cultures were negative. She was continued on her home Bactrim
for chronic UTI.  On transfer to the floor she became more
somnolent related in part to being post-ictal and also due to a
new fever up to 103, as well as an elevated WBC count and
inflammatory markers. A CXR revealed bilateral aspiration
pneumonias, likely related to her seizures. These were treated
with empiric antibiotics with significant clinical improvement
withing 36 hours. A PICC line was placed and Cefepime and Vanco
were coursed conitnued for 4 more days following discharge (~ 10
day course).

# FEN/GI: She was maintained NPO as at baseline does not take
anything by mouth. She received her medications and tube feeds
via her PEG.  Her temporary PEG tube was replaced by IR aas it
had fallen out the week prior and was due to be replaced as an
outpatient. A foley had been placed there temporarily. The
patient tolerated the new tube well.

# Cardiovascular: She was maintained on telemetry monitoring.
She was continued on her home antihypertensives.

# Pulmonary: She was successfully extubated on [**6-4**] and remained
stable from a respiratory standpoint. CXR was clear. Subsequent
aspiration PNA as above.

#CODE: full confirmed with family

The patient was discharged home in improved condition with VNA
and a plan to complete her antibiotic course, continue on
dilantin and follow-up with her primary doctor.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**]
on [**2139-6-3**] after a prolonged seizure. She was initially
admitted to the ICU,, requiring a mechanical respirations while
her seizures came under control. She was transferred to the
floor and had another seizure and subsequently developed
bilateral aspiration pneumonias. She was treated with IV
antibiotics and her Dilantin was increased.

A large IV was placed for her to get medicine at home and her
G-tube was replaced.

Because we had trouble maintaining an accurate level with her
Dilantin we switched to the infatabs and increased her dose to
100 mg in the morning and 200 mg in the evening every day. Her
level the morning of discharge was 11.2 and she was given an
extra 200 mg, which should bring her level up above 15.  Next
week she should follow up with her primary doctor and get a
level drawn. The Visiting nurses who will remove her PICC line
may be able to do this for you.

Followup Instructions:
With PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 25812**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25813**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 25814**], fax [**Telephone/Fax (1) 25815**].
