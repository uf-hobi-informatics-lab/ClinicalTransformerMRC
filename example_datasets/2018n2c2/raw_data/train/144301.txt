infarction.  Her 2 sisters are healthy.  She has 2 daughters;
one
has sarcoidosis, renal problem, and nephrolithiasis.  Another
daughter has hepatitis and asthma.


Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 97.5, HR 104, BP 157/84, RR 14, SpO2 100% on a
non-rebreather
General: pale, alopecia, bump on the left side of the head.
Neck: supple
Resp: Poor air entry at the bases
CVS: quiet but distinct S1+2
GI: hepatomegaly, soft obese abdomen with normal bowel sounds.

Neurological Exam
Mental Status: unobtainable, tries to [**Doctor Last Name **] sounds, but appears
to be actively seizing.
Cranial nerves: has corneals, a gag, normal dolls eyes movement.
PERRL 3-2 mm b/l. Fundi difficult to visualize, eyes constantly
moving due to nystagmus and resting gaze is to the left.
Sensory/Motor: actively and symmetrically withdraws all four
limbs away from noxious stimuli. Tone is increased in all four
limbs. Plantars are upgoing bilaterally.
Rest of the examination could not be performed.


Pertinent Results:
CT brain with and without contrast: Right frontal enhancing
lesion and two lesions in the left cerebellum, corresponding to
sites of known lesions as seen on MR [**8-18**]. No new lesions
identified. However, there is increased vasogenic edema in the
right frontal lobe. No significant mass effect seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro - Initially admitted to the [**Hospital 2571**] transferred to the step
down unit on [**9-25**] then to the floor on [**9-27**].  Mental status
improved.  On discharge neurologic exam - oriented to month/year
and only one day off on date, oriented to person and place.
Baseline very slight L hemiparesis but did have full strength
bilat FEs, IPs, and ankle dorsiflexion on am of discharge.

MRI showed 1.Acute left subdural hematoma, measuring up to 5 mm
in maximal thickness, layering over the left cerebral convexity
with very slight mass effect on
subjacent gyri and up to 4 mm rightward shift of the septum
pellucidum.
2. Minor acute subarachnoid hemorrhage at the bifrontovertex,
likely post-
traumatic.
3. No significant change in the right frontal metastatic lesion,
with larger
adjacent zone of vasogenic edema, particularly caudally.
4. Treated left cerebellar hemispheric metastases, unchanged,
with no new
lesion seen.
5. Stable dural enhancement, likely treatment-related.
6. Persistent fluid opacification of the mastoid air cells.

Very subtle subdural adn subarachnoid hemorrhages likely
traumatic from fall with seizures.

Treated with dexamethasone initially 4mg Q6hrs for increased
edema.  After discussion with neuro-oncology given tapered [**9-26**]
to 2mg Q6hrs, [**9-27**] to 2mg Q12 hrs for 1 day then off.

On [**9-26**] had some confusion and visual hallucinations (spiders
and ants), likely related to the steroids.  [**9-27**] hallucinations
resolved and did not recur.

Physical therapy and occupational therapy evaluated during
admission, recommended a brief rehabilitation hospitalization
prior to going home.  Goal is definitely home for her.

FEN/GI - Speech and swallowing evaluated her, initially purree
diet with nectar thick liquids recommended on [**9-27**] advanced to
ground solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision.
Electrolytes generally stable, gave one time replacement of
magnesium [**9-27**] for Mg 1.5 and started neutraphos 1 packet Qday
for phos of 2.4.  9/18 Mg 1.3, gave one more dose of mag oxide
800mg with plan to repeat electrolytes in rehab.  Increased
urine output [**2055-9-24**] then slowed down, likely diuresis from
fluids in the ICU.  Sodium remained within normal limits.

CV/Resp - Stable throughout.

ID - CXR with known mass, no evidence of pneumonia.  UA
negative.  No infectious concerns.
