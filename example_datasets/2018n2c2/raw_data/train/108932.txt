Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**]
Chief Complaint:
Cholelithiasis, duodenal perforation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2113-3-10**]: ERCP
.
[**2113-3-16**]: Successful CT-guided percutaneous drainage catheter
placement into the right perinephric space
.
[**2113-3-21**]:
1. Wide incision and drainage of retroperitoneal
abscess/infection/hematoma.
2. [**Location (un) **] patch of potential duodenal perforation region with
drainage.
3. Antecolic isoperistaltic side-to-side gastrojejunostomy.


History of Present Illness:
35F with a h/o active IV drug abuse who presented to an OSH ED
c/o jaundice and abdominal pain on [**2113-3-6**], found to have and
ultimately transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**2113-3-10**] for ERCP.  Ms.
[**Last Name (un) 110632**] reports noticing RUQ pain intermittently for the
past three months, but it had not become bad enough for her to
seek medical attention.  When she also developed jaundice
associated
with generalized malaise and myalgias, she presented to the
[**Hospital3 **] ED, where she was found to have elevated LFTS (TB
9.6, DB 6.6, alb 3.6, AST 638, ALT 640, AP 615, and WBC 13.6),
and cholelithiasis without ductal dilation on ultrasound.
Hepatitis C titer was positive.  She was admitted for further
work-up.
When MRCP on [**1-/2030**] revealed cholelithiasis, possible
cholecystitis, and cystic duct stones without CBD or IHD
dilation, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2113-3-10**] for ERCP.
ERCP revealed a laceration of the major papilla suggestive of
recent stone passage, and stones were noted in the lower CBD
with an impacted stone at the ampulla.  Sphincterotomy and stone
extraction were performed, but subsequent cholangiography
revealed constrast extravasation suggesting perforation.  Two
biliary stents and an NGT were placed, and arrangement for
direct admission to the West 2A Surgery service was made.


Past Medical History:
PMH:  Cholelithiasis, hepatitis C, IV drug abuse, anxiety,
depression, chronic low back pain, migraines

PSH:  Tubal ligation


Social History:
Unemployed and currently homeless, though she stays frequently
with her ex-husband.  Two children: ages 3 and 5.  +tobacco use,
1PPD currently.   Denies ETOH.  Using heroin, marijuana

[**2113-3-12**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large amount of intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal free air.
A large
amount of fluid in the right anterior and posterior pararenal
spaces tracking down to the lower quadrant of the abdomen. No
obvious leak of contrast to identify the site of perforation. If
needed a delayed non-contrast CT abdomen can be obtained to
assess for a delayed leak.
2. Small amount of pneumomediastinum.
3. A small simple right pleural effusion with right basilar
atelectasis.

[**2113-3-16**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Decreased but persistent large intraperitoneal and
retroperitoneal free
air. A large amount of fluid in the right retroperitoneum is
seen with
anterior displacement of the right kidney. No rim-enhancing
fluid collection is seen.
2. Decreased pneumomediastinum.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis as
described above.

[**2113-3-20**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Improvement in right lower lobe consolidation and decrease in
right
pleural effusion.
2. Slight decrease in fluid component of right perinephric
collection at site of Drain. Extensive multiloculated
phlegmonous change with no significant large fluid component to
target for drainage.
3. No new collections are identified.
4. Persistent extensive free intra-abdominal air with multiple
pockets of air surrounding the second part of duodenum, likely
at site of duodenal
perforation.

[**2113-3-29**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Decrease in size of loculated gas-fluid collections with four
drains in
place. There are small pockets of loculated collections that may
not be
adequately drained. Significant resolution of intra-abdominal
free air.
2. Right hydronephrosis likely from obstruction of ureter due to
surrounding inflammation.
3. Slight improvement in right lower lobe consolidation;
however, slight
increase in right pleural effusion.

[**2113-3-31**] RENAL US:
FINDINGS:
1. There is stable mild hydronephrosis in the right kidney.
Adjacent to the lower pole, is a partially imaged complex fluid
collection containing a drain. The right kidney measures
approximately 14 cm.
2. The left kidney measures approximately 14.2 cm. There is no
hydronephrosis, renal lesion or nephrolithiasis.
3. The bladder is minimally distended limiting evaluation and
grossly
unremarkable.

[**2113-4-6**] CT ABD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study due to lack of intravenous and oral contrast
demonstrates an interval decrease in the phlegmonous collection
in the right perinephric space now measuring 8.0 x 3.0 cm with a
drain in place. Multiple adjacent collections with air and fluid
are again noted and appear relatively stable to minimally
decreased in size. Three of the previously visualized drains
have since been removed.
2. Continued mild right hydronephrosis.
3. Resolution of right pleural effusion. Right lower lobe
opactiy has
decreased in size.
4. Two common bile duct stents are in place with pneumobilia.
5. 2-mm non-obstructive left renal stone.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service with
duodenal perforation status post ERCP. The patient was made NPO
with NGT, started on IV fluids and IV Zosyn, and Dilaudid PCA
for pain control. CT scan on HD # 2 demonstrated large amount of
fluid in the right anterior and posterior pararenal spaces
tracking down to the lower quadrant of the abdomen and large
amount of free air. Nutritional consult was called for TPN
recommendations and PICC line was placed. The patient continued
to spike low grade fever and her blood cultures were positive
for STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS, Vancomycin Iv was added on HD #
6. Repeat abdominal CT demonstrated  decreased but persistent
large intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal free  air with a large
amount of fluid in the right retroperitoneum is seen with
anterior displacement of the right kidney. The patient continued
to spike fever and IR drainage of the right retroperitoneal
fluid collection was ordered. The patient underwent CT-guided
percutaneous drainage catheter placement into the right
perinephric space on HD # 6 and fluid was sent for cultures. The
patient's diet was advanced as tolerated on POD # 8, and was
well tolerated. The cultures were positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans
and IV Fluconazole was added. Despite antibiotics treatment
patient continued to spike fever and her abdominal pain was
continued to be significantly high requiring large amount of IV
Dilaudid, Ativan and Ketorolac to manage it, patient's WBC also
continued to increased (16->38).Repeat abdominal CT scan on HD #
10 revealed slight decrease in fluid component of right
perinephric collection, extensive multi loculated phlegmonous
change with no significant large fluid component to target for
drainage and persistent extensive free intra-abdominal air with
multiple pockets of air  surrounding the second part of
duodenum. The decision was made to take the patient in OR for
washout.
On [**2112-3-20**], the patient underwent wide incision and drainage of
retroperitoneal
abscess/infection/hematoma, [**Location (un) **] patch of potential duodenal
perforation region
with drainage and antecolic isoperistaltic side-to-side
gastrojejunostomy and JP drains placement x 4, which went well
without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). Intraoperatively patient received 2 units of pRBC, she
was extubated post op and was transferred in ICU for
observation. On POD # 2, patient received 2 units of pRBC for
HCT 23.4, her post transfusion Hct was 28.3. The patient was
transferred to the floor on POD # 3, NPO on TPN and IV fluids,
and Dilaudid PCA for pain control. The patient was continued to
have low grade fever and she was continued on IV Vancomycin,
Zosyn and Fluconazole. The patient was hydrodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient is an active Heroin user. Her pain was
controlled with Dilaudid PCA and she had high requirements for
pain medication. When tolerating oral intake, the patient was
transitioned to oral Dilaudid and Chronic Pain Service was
consulted. The patient's pain medications was weaned to [**1-14**] gm
of Dilaudid PO Q4H and patient instructed to continue wean off
her pain medications in home.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization.
GI: The patient was started on TPN on admission. Her diet was
advanced to clears on HD # 6 and to regular on HD # 8. The
patient was made NPO prior surgery and TPN was continued. Diet
was advanced to clears on POD # 5 and to regular on POD # 9, TPN
was weaned off and d/c/d on POD # 8. The patient was able to
tolerate regular diet prior discharge. Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.
Renal/GU: The patient's Cre/BUN were monitored routinely, on HD
# 21 (POD # 10) her Cre increased to 1.9. During hospitalization
patient underwent several abdominal CT scans with contrast, she
received IV Vancomycin x 14 days, and she received IV Toradol
for pain control. The combination of these factors and
inflammatory respond from fluid collection, which lead to mild
right kidney hydronephrosis contributed to patient's acute renal
injury. Urology and Renal were called for consult and their
recommendations were followed. The kidney function started to
improve on POD # 16, and returned to 1.5 prior discharge. The
patient continued to urinate without any difficulties and her
electrolyte balance was generally within normal limits. The
patient will required to have a follow up Renal US to
re-evaluate her hydronephrosis in 6 months as outpatient.
ID: The patient had a positive blood cultures on admission with
STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS, she was treated with IV Vancomycin
for 14 days. Surveillance blood cultures were negative. Intra
abdominal fluid was positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] and patient was started
on IV Fluconazole for 14 days also. After discontinue of IV
antibiotics, the patient continued to spike low grade fever and
her increased on POD # 15. Blood and urine cultures were
negative, intra abdominal cultures were positive with [**Female First Name (un) 564**].
The patient was restarted on PO Fluconazole and Augmentin. WBC
and fevers subsided after abx was started. She will continue on
PO Abx for 10 days after discharge. She was discharged with one
JP left within biggest fluid collection, she will follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] in 2 weeks with Ct scan to evaluate her fluid
collection and possible d/c JP drain.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; she received total 6 units of pRBC during
hospitalization. Her Hct was stable prior discharge and no
further transfusions were required.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.
