Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Gastric Ulcers with Bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper Endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
66 year old Female with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis due to
hypertensive nephropathy, and h/o NSCLC on Tarceva and
nephrolithiasis who presents with symptomatic anemia.  The
patient typically adjusts her weekly EPO injections between
4000-6000 units depending on her symptoms of fatigue and
dyspnea.  Two and a half weeks ago her dialysis nurse had her
terminate EPO in the setting of an elevated hmg > 12 per her
report. She has been waiting to hear back from her dialysis
clinic regarding when to restart her EPO.  She titrates her own
EPO, given a similar episode of severe symptomatic anemia. In
the interim she developed excruciating flank pain earlier this
week for which she presented to the ED, a CT demonstrated
bilateral stones.  She was given toradol and vicodin and
discharged home with total resolution of her pain.  However, as
the week progressed, she has become progressively constipated
and fatigued with suprapubic abdominal pain.  She reports her PD
fluid has been clear.  She had an episodic visit at [**Company 191**] on
Thursday which prompted referral to the ED. Her blood pressure
was 112/72 laying and 94/68 standing. Blood cultures were taken,
but patient denied any fevers or chills. She got IVF
(approximately 500 cc). Her labs were significant for a
hematocrit of 27, down from 36 on [**2-13**]. She was guiac negative.
Her potassium was elevated at 6, she was given kayexalate. She
had an abdominal CT which showed nothing acute. A CXR was
negative for acute processes. Repeat orthostatics were: lying HR
75 BP 135/63,  standing HR 85 BP 127/61.  On transfer to the
floor her abdominal pain had completely resolved in the setting
of a large dark brown bowel movement after receiving kayexalate.
 She did not receive PD o/n.

ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, vomiting, diarrhea, BRBPR, hematochezia.
She makes trace amounts of urine. She notes acid reflux for the
past 3 days that has been constant. She has only been eating
peppermints do to her poor appetite.

Pertinent Results:
CHEST XRAY [**2153-2-15**]
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The cardiac silhouette is
normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
Chain sutures within the left lower lobe are again demonstrated.
Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Left lower lobe mass is
again noted, better seen on the prior CT, but similar compared
to the prior study. Nodular opacity within the left upper lobe
appears relatively unchanged from prior. Small left pleural
effusion persists. The right lung is grossly clear. No
pneumothorax is identified.  Multiple clips are demonstrated
within the thyroid bed. Left proximal humeral fracture appears
chronic.

IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in appearance of left
lower lobe lung mass, and nodule in the left upper lobe.
Persistent small left pleural effusion.

CT ABDOMEN w/out contrast [**2153-2-15**]
CT OF THE ABDOMEN:
There is unchanged left lower lobe round nodule with associated
surgical
material and small left pleural effusion and mild bibasilar
atelectasis.
Unchanged multiple pulmonary nodules at the right lung base.
Segment III liver hypodensity is stable and was previously
characterized as a hemangioma. Adjacent sub-cm hypodensity in
the left lobe is also unchanged.  The gallbladder, spleen,
bilateral adrenal glands and pancreas are normal.  Unchanged
splenic artery calcifications. The kidneys are atrophic with
numerous calcifications, likely vascular, and cysts, unchanged
from priors.  The stomach, duodenum, small bowel are normal.
A peritoneal dialysis (PD) cathether is visualized in the left
lower quadrant with unchanged small 17 x 8 mm seroma in the
subcutaneous soft tissues and moderate amount of ascites.
Unchanged calcification of the aorta and its major branches.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.

CT OF THE PELVIS:
The urinary bladder is normal. There is no pelvic
lymphadenopathy, no pelvic hernias.

BONES: There are moderate degenerative change at L5-S1 with
intervertebral
disc disease.
.
IMPRESSION: No acute process or interval change from 2 days
prior, including no evidence of diverticulitis or appendicitis.
.
PORTABLE CHEST XRAY [**2153-2-18**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-15**]:
Mild interstitial abnormality in the right lung is probably
edema. Moderate left pleural effusion is increasing. Large left
lung lesions also appear grown since [**2-15**], though this is
probably mostly a function of projection between the PA and AP
orientations. Heart size top normal. Mediastinal veins and upper
lobe pulmonary vessels are slightly dilated.

           (Reference Range-Negative).

EGD: [**2153-2-16**]
Impression:	Multiple superficial ulcers in the stomach antrum
Few cratered ulcers in the pre-pyloric region
A single cratered ulcer with stigmata of recent bleeding in the
pre-pyloric region (injection)
Bulbar duodenitis
Brunner's gland hyperplasia in the duodenal bulb
Scalloping folds on the mucosa of the second and third parts of
the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations:	The findings account for the symptoms, and the
distribution of the gastric ulcers suggests that they are
NSAID-induced.
Continue PPI, avoid all aspirin or NSAID products.
Follow serial Hcts, transfuse PRBCs to Hct >30. Consider DDAVP
and/or platelet transfusion for uremic platelets.
Check H.pylori serology, treat if positive.
Check TTG and IgA to exclude Celiac disease.
If re-bleeds will need repeat EGD.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
Ms. [**Known lastname 92380**] is a 66 year old woman with ESRD on PD, NSCLC, anemia,
and thyroid cancer who presented with an upper GI bleed. She
required multiple transfusions and transfer to the MICU where
upper endoscopy revealed bleeding gastric ulcers secondary to
recent NSAID use.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Gastric Ulcers with Bleeding,
Duodenitis:
Symptomatic anemia in the setting of a significant drop in Hct
over a three day period. (36->27->22) Etiology initially
concerning for discontinuation of weekly epogen in setting of
elevated hmg on routine lab draw.  The patient has past history
of dramatic hct drop off epo. She received 1x dose of tordol
during ED visit on Monday. No other NSAID use or history of
GERD. Most recent colonscopy in [**2146**] demonstrated multiple
polyps. Follow up colonoscopy deferred given NSCLC. Initially no
evidence of acute bleed, guaic negative stool in the ED prior to
transfer, however on the morning of admission the patient passed
four melanolic stool, guaic positive.  Her hct dropped to 22,
she was transfused 1 unit of pRBC and given desmopressin. Two
PIVs were placed, she was started on PPI gtt and 1 more unit
pRBC and transferred to MICU for EDG and further management. EGD
revealed multiple gastric ulcers in antrum, one of which had
stigmata of recent bleed with overlying dark area. This area was
injected.  There was no evidence of active bleeding.  The
duodenal bulb was acutely inflammed and edematous w/o discrete
ulcer or bleeding.  Patient received additional 2 units pRBCS
after procedure, with subsequent stabilization in HCT and
hemodynamics.  Her diet was advanced to clears, and she was
stable to be transferred back to the general medicine floor.
Her hematocrit continued to be stable.  Pantoprazole was changed
to PO BID dosing which she will continue on for 6 weeks.  She
will discuss further epoitin dosing with her outpatient
nephrologist. Hpylori negative. IgA at normal levels.

# Flank Pain:
The patient has was admitted to the ED prior to admission for
left sided plank pain for which she was prescribed vicodin for
pain managment. An episode of this flank pain recurred on
admission.  Physical exam demonstrated left flank tenderness to
palpation. CT abdomen on [**2-13**] demonstrated bilateral stones and
CT abdomen two days later demonstrated calcified atrophic
kidneys.  Unclear if pain is secondary to stones as patient is
PD dependant and almost anuric. Would consider outpatient MRI to
investigate for nerve impingement.  Her pain was treated with
vicodin.

# Abdominal Pain Diffuse:
Completely resolved in setting of large bowel movement on night
of admission. She was afebrile, but given her history of
peritonitis and PD, fluid sent for culture and gram stain.  Gram
stain revealed 1+ polys and no microorganisms, culture was
negative. Blood cultures were negative at the time of discharge.


# ESRD:
Renal fellow contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding admission. Peritoneal dialysis
was started per home regimen. Epoetin dosing to be discussed
with outpatient nephrologist. The patient became mildly fluid
overloaded in setting of multiple transfusions and clear diet.
CXR demonstrated small pleural effusion. Her PD dialsylate was
adjusted as indicated.

# Hyperkalemia:
Hyperkalemic on admission. She received kayexalate with
improvement in her potassium.  No peaked T waves.

# Hypothyroidism:
Continued home levothyroxine dose.

# NSCLC: On Tarceva every three days. Patient stated she will
not take until appetite improved.  Heme/onc was called, and
placed orders for patient to continue on Tarceva as per home
regimen.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for management of an upper GI bleed.  An upper
endoscopy demonstrated multiple ulcers in your stomach.  It is
likely that the tordol you received during your prior ED visit
precipitated the development of these ulcers.  A small injection
of epinephrine in one of the bleeding ulcers was made which
stopped the bleeding.  You required multiple blood transfusions.
You were started on pantoprazole twice daily. You will need to
continue this medication for six weeks and then may take it just
once daily.

You developed left sided flank pain that appears to be an
intermittant chronic issue. Please discuss with your primary
care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] MRI to explore the cause of your intermittant
spasms.

Please discuss with your nephrologist how much epoetin you
should be taking.
