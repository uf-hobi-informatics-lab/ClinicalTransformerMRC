IMAGING:
Head CT 8/18(6am):
There is extraaxial (likely subdural) hemorrhage within the left
posterior
fossa inferior, lateral and posterior to the cerebellum with
mass effect on the left cerebellar hemisphere narrowing the
fourth ventricle. Blood tracks along the tentorium and into the
left cerebellopontine angle.
There is a small amount of blood within the dependent aspect of
the left
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. There is dilatation of the lateral ventricles
and dilatation of the temporal horns bilaterally, consistent
with mild degree of hydrocephalus. The suprasellar cistern and
basal cisterns are grossly patent. There is no definite
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation abnormality. Subcortical and
periventricular foci of hypoattenuation are likely related to
microvascular ischemic chronic changes. The patient is status
post bilateral cataract surgery. Intracranial vascular
calcifications are noted. There is no depressed skull fracture.
The
visualized mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are grossly
clear. There is right nasal septum deviation, morphology favors
chronic finding with no acute fracture noted.
IMPRESSION:
Posterior fossa extra-axial hematoma, most likely subdural.
Intraventricular hemorrhage. Mild hydrocephalus. Mild mass
effect on the cerebellum with narrowing of the fourth ventricle.
No definite herniation at this time.

Head CT 8/18(6pm):
FINDINGS: The hemorrhage in the left posterior fossa appears
similar to the prior exam approximately eight hours earlier.
There appears to be a subdural collection forming along the
cerebellopontine angle which is similar to prior exam. There is
blood in the left lateral ventricle layering dependently again
unchanged from prior examination. There is dilation of the
lateral ventricles and temporal horns which is unchanged. The
third ventricle is enlarged with effacement of the fourth
ventricle, not significantly different from prior examination.
There is a similar amount of left to right shift in the
cerebellum. There are low lying cerebellar tonsils. There does
not appear to be any new areas of hemorrhage. The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are unremarkable. There
is no osseous abnormality identified. There are periventricular
and deep white matter hypodensities consistent with
chronic small vessel ischemic disease. There are prominent sulci
consistent with age-related changes. There is a possible osteoma
in the right sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**].
IMPRESSION: Similar amount of left posterior fossa hemorrhage
with mass
effect. There is a similar amount of left to right shift and
low-lying
cerebellar tonsils without definite herniation. Recommend
continued close
follow-up.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the ED  with positive head CT for ICH
we reversed INR by using Profiline and FFP as the patient takes
warfarin. The patient was noted to have coffee ground emesis she
was given given pantoprazole 40 mg IV her hematocrit was 31. She
was admitted to the SICU and had serial crits which remained
stable. Her head CT were done frequently X2 which showed no
change. Her BP parameters were kept less  SBP<140. She remained
neurologically stable and was transferred to the step down area
on [**9-5**]. she continued to have guaiac positive stools. [**9-6**] Head
Ct revealed decrease blood. She developed some right knee pain
and bilateral leg pain on palpation, LENIs were negative for dvt
and plain film of knee negative for fracture or effusion. The
patient had no further episodes of emesis. She was able to
tolerate a ground diet. Neurologically she was: alert and
oriented to self, she is able to follow commands. Bilateral
upper extremities full strength and antigravity with lower
extremities.

A drop in her Na level was noted. The patient was started on PO
salt tabs on [**9-9**], and her Na came up nicely to 133.  At the
time of discharge we are recommending daily Na checks with a
fluid restriction of 750cc/day.

If Na should continue to drop, it may be beneficial to add Salt
tabs, and or to send urine electrolytes to asses the cause of
her hyponatremia.
