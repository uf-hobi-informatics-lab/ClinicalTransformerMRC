Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status; transfer from MICU

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation; now s/p extubation

History of Present Illness:
71M with multiple myeloma currently on Velcade, mixed
obstructive-restrictive lung disease, PAF, presented to the ED
on [**2167-8-29**] complaining of polyuria.  Per sister, patient has
been fatigued with poor po intake for several weeks. She is not
aware of any acute changes in his health. She took him to his
Velcade appointment on Friday, where he felt fatigued but was of
normal mood and behavior.  He received day 4 of his Velcade at
this time as well as 1u PRBCs.
.
His VS on presentation to the ED were T 99.6, HR 68, BP 106/56,
RR 25, O2sat 97% RA.  His K was 6.0, so he was given Kayexalate
30g. On exam, he had RUQ tenderness with a normal RUQ
ultrasound. He was also noted to be somewhat dyspneic with an
elevated D-dimer so he was sent for a V/Q scan to rule out a PE.
.
Halfway through the scan, he became agitated and combative and
had stool incontinence.  His VS upon return were HR 110, BP
144/65, O2sat 89% NRB. He was dyspneic, diaphoretic, and
nonverbal. He was given Ativan 1mg IV for agitation. On lung
exam, he had very poor air movement. He was intubated in the ED
for airway protection with altered mental status and hypoxic
respiratory failure. CXR showed clear lungs. He was given
Solumedrol 125mg IV, Benadryl 50mg IV, and Pepcid 20mg IV to
treat possible allergic reaction to the radionuclide material.
He was also started on a propofol gtt for sedation and 2L NS. He
was admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
In the MICU, he was quickly weaned off of the ventilator and on
to a nasal cannula at 2L/min on the morning of [**2167-8-31**].  His
mental status remained somewhat impaired in that he was never
fully oriented to place.  He had 2 sets of blood cultures sent
(though it's unclear if he was ever febrile) and grew gram(+)
cocci in pairs/clusters from 3/4 bottles; he was started on
vancomycin.  His sputum culture also had 4+ gram(+) cocci in
pairs/chains.  His warfarin was initially held due to the
possibility of an LP but this was never done since his mental
status seemed to be improving.


Past Medical History:
Oncologic History:
Multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**12/2164**] after presenting with
several months of diffuse bony pain; found to have numerous
lytic bony lesions and a monocloncal kappa protein in his UPEP
(>8 grams of kappa proteinuria); diagnosed with stage IIIB kappa
light chain multiple myeloma.  He initially responded well to
Decadron and was then intolerant to thalidomide/Decadron; he
subsequently responded well to Cytoxan/Decadron with a marked
decrease in his kappa excretion and improvement inhis renal
function.  In [**7-/2165**], he underwent an autologous SCT after
treatment with high-dose melphalan.  He went into remission at
this time which he maintained until [**7-/2167**] when he presented to
the ED with dyspnea on exertion; he was found to have 20 grams
of Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] proteinuria and new diabetes insipidus.  A bone
marrow biopsy showed >60% plasma cells.  He was pulsed with
Decadron and discharged on po Decadron for his MM and intranasal
ddAVP for his DI.  On [**2167-8-25**], he was started on Velcade (in
addition to his [**Hospital1 **] Decadron).  He received days 1 and 4 of
Velcade prior to this presentation.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the MICU, he was quickly weaned off of the ventilator and on
to a nasal cannula at 2L/min on the morning of [**2167-8-31**].  His
mental status remained somewhat impaired in that he was never
fully oriented to place.  He had 2 sets of blood cultures sent
(though it's unclear if he was ever febrile) and grew gram(+)
cocci in pairs/clusters from 3/4 bottles; he was started on
vancomycin.  His sputum culture also had 4+ gram(+) cocci in
pairs/chains.  His warfarin was initially held due to the
possibility of an LP but this was never done since his mental
status seemed to be improving.
.
Upon transfer to the floor:
.
A/P: 71M with multiple myeloma, mixed obstructive-restrictive
lung disease, ? DI, and PAF, admitted after acute episode of
altered mental status (of unclear etiology) now extubated and
transferred out of the MICU. Gram (+) cocci growing from blood.
.
## ID:
- [**1-24**] blood culture bottles from admission grew vanc-sensitive
coag negative Staph; he completed a 10-day course of IV
vancomycin and remained afebrile
- sputum culture grew non-Pseudomonas gram negative rods (CXR
normal); completed course of levofloxacin
- ceftriaxone was added for 3 days ([**Date range (1) 18881**]) due to concern
for meningitis with his second change in mental status (see
below) and was stopped once mental status returned to baseline
and it became clear there was no meningitis
.
# Mental status change:
-On the night of [**9-3**], the patient became acutely psychotic and
agitated.  He was very worried that people were smoking crack in
the halls and that there were people trying to hurt the nurses
and sabotage Dr[**Name (NI) 6168**] practice.   His warfarin and steroids
were stopped at this time. A psych consult was obtained the next
morning who recommended Haldol/Cogentin.  He required sedation
with Haldol/Ativan/Dilaudid to get a head CT (which was negative
for a bleed).  Following sedation, the next evening, he was
noted to be very rigid and received an additional dose of
Cogentin.  A neuro consult was obtained the next day who
recommended stopping Haldol due to the rigidity.  Per neuro
consult, an LP was attempted twice to rule out CNS infection,
but the patient was too agitated; he was treated empirically
with vanco/ceftriaxone until it was clear that there was no
meningitis; he had a persistently non-focal neuro exam with no
menigeal signs.  An EEG showed nonspecific slowing consistent
with his sedation.  Infectious workup (CXRs, cultures) remained
negative and he remained afebrile.  His mental status slowly
returned to baseline overnight on [**2171-9-6**], presumably as the
effects of the steorids wore off.  He was taken off of 1:1
observation and remained calm and cooperative.  Further
psychoactive meds (except for pain control meds) were held.
.
## Multiple myeloma: Currently on Velcade, last dose 10/6, and
dexamethasone.
- he was continued on his outpatient dexamethasone regimen (8mg
po bid) but this was stopped on [**9-6**] when he developed
psychosis; there were some indications that he might not have
been taking this at home, and his self-limited psychosis was
thought to be secondary to the steroids
.
## ?DI/endocrine:
- during previous admission there was a reported history of
diabetes insipidus; a water deprivation test was done during
that admission, though endocrine did not see the patient.
Endocrine was consulted this time and recommended a pituitary
MRI which showed a lack of expected hyperintensity in the
neurohypophysis.  No water deprivatino test was done, though his
ddAVP was stopped when he became psychotic and his sodium
remained normal with normal urine output.  Per endo, he does not
need to be on ddAVP.  Also noted were low TSH, T4, T3, fT4
levels.  A rT3 was slightly high and endocrine recommended
repeat thyroid functino tests in [**12-26**] weeks (suspect sick
euthyroid) for follow-up with no thyroid replacement at this
time.

.
## Obstructive/restrictive lung disease: Unclear etiology. MRI
chest showed no PE and PA hypertension
- continued Advair
- weaned off of O2 as tolerated
.
## PAF: Currently rate-controlled.
- cont metoprolol and short-acting diltiazem for rate control
- warfarin was stopped due to mental status changes; with his
continued gait instability, it was deemed too unsafe for him to
continue warfarin, especially since he was not in AFib at all
during the admisison
.
## Endocrine
- dexamethasone as above
- TSH, T4, fT4 all low; ?sick euthyroid
.
## Hypertension:
- continued on his metoprolol and diltiazem
.
## FEN: Poor po intake x weeks per sister; NPO in MICU
- 500cc NS bolus then NS at 125cc/hr; check fluid status closely
- daily lytes; watch for rising sodium
- dysphagia diet, thickened liquids; may need speech/swallow
eval
.
## Code status: with his psychosis, he was made DNR/DNI by his
sister (due to his advanced myeloma) when he did not have
capacity to make medical decisions
.
## Communication: sister [**Name (NI) 18882**] [**Name (NI) 634**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 18883**]
.
## Dispo: pt is deconditioned and unsteady on his feet and, per
primary team and PT, needs rehab

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital1 **] Senior Living

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary diagnosis: change in mental status, multiple myeloma,
steroid psychosis

Secondary diagnosis: paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
hypertension, osteoarthritis s/p bilateral knee replacements,
restrictive and obstructive pulmonary disease


Discharge Condition:
stable


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after an acute change in your
mental status which required intubation in order to protect your
airway.  After you were extubated, you were sent from the
intensive care unit to the floor.  While on the floor, you again
had an abrupt change in your mental status where you were
hallucinating and feeling very paranoid; it is thought that this
was due to your high steroid dose which has since been stopped.
Your warfarin (Coumadin) has been stopped due to bleeding risks.
 Your intranasal ddAVP was stopped since we do not believe that
you need it.  You are being discharged to a rehab facility so
that you may regain your strength.

Please attend all follow-up appointments.  Please take all
medications as prescribed.
