.
This information is designed as a guideline to assist you in a
speedy recovery from your surgery. Please follow these
guidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you
otherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any
questions. Dial 911 if you have any medical emergency.
.
ACTIVITY:
.
There are restrictions on activity. On the side of your
amputation you are non weight bearing until cleared by your
Surgeon. You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever
possible.
.
You may use the other leg to assist in transferring and pivots.
But try not to exert to much pressure on the amputation site
when transferring and or pivoting. Please keep knee immobilizer
on at all times to help keep the amputation site straight.
.
No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.
.
PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:
.
Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s) .
.
Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever
greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus
draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these
or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.
.
Exercise:
.
Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks.
.
Do not drive a car unless cleared by your Surgeon.
.
Try to keep leg elevated when able.
.
BATHING/SHOWERING:
.
You may shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. A
dressing may cover you??????re amputation site and this should be
left in place for three (3) days. Remove it after this time and
wash your incision(s) gently with soap and water. You will have
sutures, which are usually removed in 3 weeks. This will be done
by the Surgeon on your follow-up appointment.
.
WOUND CARE:
.
An appointment will be made for you to return for suture
removal.
.
When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place
pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will
stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these
do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm
water and soap in the shower.
.
Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for
four weeks after surgery.
.
MEDICATIONS:
.
Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the
medications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a
new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every
three (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary.
.
Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you
should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check
with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel
that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may
use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite
suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small
balanced meals throughout the day.
.
CAUTIONS:
.
NO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is
an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of
your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you
smoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse
or doctor for information on smoking cessation.
.
Avoid pressure to your amputation site.
.
No strenuous activity for 6 weeks after surgery.
.
DIET :
.
There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively.
Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent
meals may be preferred.
.
For people with vascular problems we would recommend a
cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and
low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile
in your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in
serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a
reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that
most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to
decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the
bad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density
Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's
permission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred
or get a referral from your doctor.
.
If you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight
management program. Your health and its improvement depend on
it. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be
easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new
attitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get
a referral from your doctor.
.
If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may
request a referral from your doctor.
.
FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT:
.
Be sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your
improving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the
chronic medical conditions that you have. Things like high blood
pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to
the blood vessels. Don't let them go untreated!
.
Please call the office on the first working day after your
discharge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit. This
should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days
after discharge. Normal office hours are 8:30-5:30 Monday
through Friday.
.
