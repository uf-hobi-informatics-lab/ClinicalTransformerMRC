Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
renal failure s/p CRT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
HD line placement

History of Present Illness:
61M with history of ESRD s/p CRT [**2101**], hypertension, diabetes,
diastolic CHF, admitted on [**2107-11-12**] with acute on chronic
dyspnea, now s/p PEA arrest. He presented on [**11-12**] with 2 days of
worsening dyspnea, cough, and fever/chills.  Also with
orthopnea, PND, and worsening edema in all 4 extremities.
.
Labs showed ARF with creatinine of 5.8 (up from 2.9).  During
hospital course on the floor, renal function continued to worsen
and urine output was low even with furosemide (unclear etiology
of ARF).  Also noted to have intermittent somnolence but
arousable and fully oriented.  ABGs repeatedly with partially
compensated respiratory acidosis (has also had this in the
recent past), team unsure how reliable ABGs were given bilateral
UE fistulas.
.
Patient was in angio having hemodialysis line placed when his
arrest event occurred.  He was placed in a lateral decubitus
position due to difficulty lying flat due to shortness of
breath.  Towards the end of his line placement, he became more
agitated and was pushing his facemask away.  O2 sats were unable
to be obtained.  He was then placed in supine position for line
suturing.  He was then noted to be nonresponsive, code blue
call.  Then noted to be pulseless.  CPR initiated and initial
rhythm asystole/very slow PEA, subsequently faster PEA.  Total
pulseless time 13 minutes.  Received total 2 mg epinephrine, 2
amps bicarb, 1 mg atropine, insulin/D50, IVFs via new HD line.
Regained pulses with first SBP >180.  Intubated.
.
In the MICU, patient seemed to be waking up some but with also
evidence of extensor posturing in upper and lower extremities.
Neuro consulted.  Aline and CVL placed.
.
Review of systems: unable to obtain

.
CXR [**2107-11-14**]: In comparison with the study of [**11-12**], there are
lower lung volumes. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
persists with mild vascular congestion suggested.
.
EKG: NSR at 94, NANI, low limb lead voltage, poor RWP (old); no
significant change from prior.
.
TTE [**2107-11-14**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very
small circumferenital pericardial effusion.
.
Renal ultrasound [**11-13**]:  No new findings.
.
CT Chest [**11-15**]:  On CT, there is no evidence of air embolism.
Cardiomegaly, mild axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Bilateral pleural effusions with areas of subsequent
atelectasis, patchy lower lobe predominant parenchymal opacity
is potentially suggestive of a combination of pneumonia and
atelectasis. No pathologic air collection in the mediastinum and
the lung interstitium.
.
CT Head [**11-15**]:  1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute
vascular territorial infarction. There is no hydrocephalus.
2. Opacification of sphenoid sinus, maxillary, ethmoid air cells
and
nasopharynx, most likely related to recent intubation.
.
CT Head [**11-17**]:  1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or obvious
major territorial acute infarct, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
If there is continued concern, MR of the head with
diffusion-weighted imaging sequence is more sensitive in the
detection of acute stroke.
2. Diffuse opacification of the sphenoid sinus, nasopharynx, the
maxillary
and the ethmoid air cells partly related to mucosal thickening,
secretions
from intubation. However, patient also had a left antrochoanal
polyp in the past, which is incompletely assessed on the present
study.
3. Discontinuous foci in the left parietal bone may relate to
thinning of the bone, from arachnoid granulations or other
etiology, to correlate with any history of surgery. However,
this appearance is unchanged compared to the prior CT sinus
study done on [**2102-10-19**].
.
RUE US [**11-20**]:  Although subclavian vein not evaluated, remainder
of right upper extremity venous system appears normal with no
evidence of DVT, and DVT would be likely in the subclavian vein
given respiratory variation and normal appearance of remainder
of the study.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**11-21**]:  1. Severely limited examination demonstrates
changes of chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease
with old left frontal encephalomalacia without evidence for
acute infarct.
2. Extensive paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell disease.
.
KUB [**11-25**]:  1. Severely limited examination demonstrates changes
of chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease with old
left frontal encephalomalacia without evidence for acute
infarct.
2. Extensive paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell disease.
.
KUB [**11-26**]:   There is no evidence of free air. NG tube tip is in
the stomach. Right femoral catheter remains in place. There is
no evidence of bowel obstruction. There is nonspecific bowel gas
pattern.
.
Portable Abdomen XR [**11-29**]:  There is no evidence of ileus, small
or large bowel obstruction.
.
Abdominal US [**12-6**]:  Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound with
no findings to suggest the cause of the patient's pain.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**12-6**]:  1. Small thrombus within the IVC and at the
junction of the right common iliac vein and transplanted renal
vein.
2. Diffuse mesenteric stranding with no small or large bowel
pathology
identified.
.
CT Head [**12-11**]:  1. . No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Partial opacification of mastoid air cells bilaterally,
maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, partly polypoidal.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**12-11**]:  1. Very large spontaneous hematoma
involving a majority of the left hepatic lobe. A small amount of
perihepatic hematoma and scattered areas of blood within the
mesentery and along the left pericolic gutters tracking into the
pelvis. No definite site of active extravasation identified.
2. Branches of left portal vein are attenuated and not well
visualized in
the midst of the hematoma but are patent.
3. No change in small 1.5 cm thrombus within the infrarenal IVC.
Second
separate smaller thrombus in the right common iliac vein near
the transplant renal vein anastomosis on the prior study not
definitely visualized and may have cleared with anticoagulation.

4. Atelectasis of both dependent lower lobes.
5. More confluent consolidative opacity of the superior right
lower lobe
could be explained with atelectasis but is concerning for
possible area of
aspiration or pneumonia.
.
CT Abdomen [**12-16**]:  Limited study but no gross evidence of
obstruction.
.
CXR [**12-19**]:  There is interval development of vascular
engorgement, perihilar opacities, and bibasilar opacities, left
more than right, findings which might be consistent with
interval progression of pulmonary edema. Evaluation after
diuresis is recommended to exclude the possibility of underlying
infectious process.


Brief Hospital Course:
61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF.
During IR placement of an HD catheter he suffered a PEA arrest x
2. He was cooled using artic sun protocol. He slowly recovered,
but his hospitalization was complicated by prolonged intubation
leading to tacheostomy placement, Psuedomonas UTI, HAP,
Stenotrophomonas PNA, aspiration PNA, acute on chronic kidney
injury leading to loss of fuction of his transplanted kidney,
IVC thombosis, spontaneous intrahepatic hemorrage during
heparinization for his thrombus, gout flair, and altered mental
status which has slowly improved. After more than a month in the
hospital he has stabilized, is ambulating with assistance,
speaking through a Passe Muir valve, and tolerating tube feeds.
.
# Aspiration:  Patient had emesis [**2107-12-13**] and aspirated tube
feeds. Developed aspiration pneumonitis vs. aspiration PNA. CXR
showed no clear evidence of PNA but CT showed confluent
consolidative opacity of superior RLL. Pt was febrile following
aspiration event and ended up re-intubated. Now s/p 7-day course
of vanc/zosyn for aspiration that ended on [**2107-12-18**]. Respiratory
status has dramatically improved and he is now on trach mask
only. He had a video swallow evaluation on [**2107-12-20**] which showed
silent aspiration.  It was suggested that he have a diet of
nectar thick liquids and soft consistency solids.  meds must be
crushed in purees with Q6 hour oral care.  He should have follow
up with speech therapy at rehab with repeat video swallow if
diet is to be advanced.
.
# Stenotrophomonas PNA: Diagnosed from repeated sputum cultures.
On Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]. Note that
Bactrim must be give FOLLOWING HD as it is dialyzed off.
Intially diagnosed [**12-2**], but was inadquately treated as Bactrim
was given prior to HD rather than after.
.
# Pseudomonas UTI: Had a long course of Cefepime for UCx
positive for Pseudomonas x 2.
.
# Line infection: S/p Cefepime initially for UTI. Then Linezolid
was added for purulent appearing CVL. His lines were exchanged
and complicated by PEA arrest during procedure. His CVL grew out
Micrococcus. According to ID, the Cefepime should have covered
it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
Linezolid. A PICC line and new HD line were placed and have had
no further complications.
.
# Labile blood pressures: Pt had been intermittently hypotensive
(infectious source vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency). His
infections were treated. He was given stress dose steroids. He
was on pressors for hypotension. Ultimately this resolved and he
became persistently hypertensive to the 190s to 220s. He was
started on a labetalol drip as well as PRN hydralazine. He has
been transitioned from Labetalol drip to PO Labetalol on [**12-9**],
then switched to Labetalol PRN. On [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c??????ed.
Continue atenolol at 50mg daily. Continue lisinopril 10mg daily.

.
# Foot Pain:  Likely gout, particularly given resolving hematoma
and renal failure. Receiveing pulse steroids with Prednisone
40mg daily x5 days starting on [**2107-12-20**]. Will resume chronic
Prednisone 5mg PO daily for maintenance of transplanted kidney
thereafter. [**Month (only) 116**] need suppressive allopurinol in the future for
his gout.
.
# DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver
hematoma developed (see helow). Hematology was consulted
regarding whether it is appropriate to resume anticoagulation
given the risk of bleed, and recommended SC Heparin tid until he
follows up with Hematology and possibly vascular surgery
regarding possible benefits vs. risks of an IVC filter
placement. The patient should not be anti-coagulated with agents
other than SC Heparin given his high risk of bleed.
.
# Abdominal Distension:  Patient??????s abdomen became distended and
tympanitic during this hospitalization. CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed
large liver hematoma with scattered areas of perihepatic
hematoma and scattered blood within the mesentery but without
definite sites of active extravasation.  Distension likely [**2-7**]
chemical peritonitis which is resolving following reversal of
anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]??????s syndrome from
infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient??????s
continued +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not
show dilated R side of colon and loops of bowel were read as
WNL.  Currently improved abdominal pain and minimally improved
distension. Abd is much less tense than prior.  Continue Reglan
2.5mg TID standing for treatment of presumed diabetic
gastroparesis. Advancing diet as tolerated with tube feeds.
.
# Liver Hematoma:  As above, CT showed hematoma of liver while
on heparin drip for IVC thombus.  IR consulted re: possible
embolization, did not feel the bleed was acute (felt >48 hours
old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery and liver function if
possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General surgery
consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the
hematoma.  Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing
as needed and keeping Hct >20.  Received total of 3 unit pRBC
after reversal of PTT with FFP. Awaiting hematology
recommendation for long term anticoagulation given presence of
IVC thombus but complication of hemorrhage. (Ultimately decided
to hold all anticoagulation given severity of liver bleed.)
.
# Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest
with hypoxia beforehand. Was very difficult to wean from vent
due to persistent hypoxia, recurrent PNA, and altered mental
status. Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**]. Now stable on trach. Had
aspiration even as above leading to short tern re-intubation.
Now tolerating trach mask. Speaking with Passe Muir valve.
.
# Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest: S/p PEA arrest x 2.
Underwent Artic Sun cooling protocol. Suring weaning of sedation
was severely agitated. Ultimately was transitioned from fentanyl
to methadone and then weaned on seroquel. He had a significant
set back from his liver hematoma and aspiration PNA. Neuro was
consulted and noted a staring spell that was concerning for
seizures. He was monitored with continuous EEG, which showed
epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. Neuro
recommended startingKeppra, with Keppra 500mg qday and an extra
250mg after HD. The patient has slowly improved and is not
conversant, [**Location (un) 1131**], walking with assistance, and no longer
agitated. He is alert and oriented.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure. He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].
Etiology of ARF likely multifactorial due to hypotension from
PEA, sepsis, contrast loads, and nephrotoxic drugs. Her the
Renal Service, he will not recover renal function of his kidney.
He will require HD henceforth. Continue prednisone 5mg PO daily
for rejection as well as Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 800 tid.
.
# FEN:  Speech and Swallow Recs - video swallow: silent
aspiration seen on s/s for thin liquids. Recs: 1. Suggest a PO
diet of nectar thick liquids and soft consistency solids. 2. PMV
on for all POs. 3. Meds crushed with purees. 4. Monitor for
nutritional intake. 5. Q6 oral care. 6. Follow up speech therapy
in rehab s/p d/c

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted initially for volume overload and shortness of
breath. You had a long and complicated hospitalization for
treatment of this and various complications. You suffered a
severe type of heart attack called a PEA arrest. You required
life support from this event and were dependent on a breathing
machine for several weeks. Due to this a tracheostomy (breathing
tube in your neck) and feeding tube were placed. You had several
infections including a urinary tract infection, blood infection,
and pneumonias. You developed a clot in your veins and was
placed on blood thinners. Unfortunately, you bled while on the
blood thinners and these were stopped. Your kidney function
worsened and your transplanted kidney stopped functioning. You
were restarted on dialysis.
.
Please continue to take your medications as ordered.
