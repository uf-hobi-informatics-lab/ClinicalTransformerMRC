HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60-year-old male
with metastatic melanoma, admitted to begin cycle 1, week 1
high-dose IL-2 therapy. His oncologic history began in [**2184-7-27**], when he noted a right groin skin tag which grew quickly
over 2 months. Excisional biopsy in [**2184-10-27**] revealed a
greater than 11 mm thick, ulcerated melanoma with perineural
invasion and mitotic rate of 8 per meters squared. He was
referred to Cutaneous [**Hospital **] Clinic, at which point 2
subcutaneous nodules along the right groin scar were noted
and a left posterior shoulder subcutaneous nodule was noted.
Fine needle aspiration confirmed a melanoma at the site. PET
CT revealed widespread metastases in the lung, liver,
subcutaneous tissues and bone. Brain MRI was negative. He was
evaluated for high-dose IL-2 and passed eligibility testing
to begin therapy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  BPH, status post laparoscopic
cholecystectomy in [**2178**], left knee arthroscopic surgery
complicated by left DVT, hypertension, sleep apnea,
osteoarthritis of the right knee, melanoma as above, benign
positional vertigo, history of pseudogout, history of C-7
narrowing with occasional nerve pain.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril 20 mg daily, on hold, Flomax 0.4 mg
daily, Proscar 5 mg daily, Naprosyn 500 daily to b.i.d.
p.r.n.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Well-appearing male in no
acute distress. Performance status 1. VITAL SIGNS: 97.5, 130,
18, 133/80, O2 saturation 94% in room air. HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic. Sclerae anicteric. Moist oral
mucosa without lesions, multiple scalp nodules present. NECK:
Supple. LYMPH NODES: No cervical, supraclavicular, bilateral
axillary or bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. Right groin
subcutaneous nodules noted. HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm,
S1 and S2. CHEST:  Clear to percussion and auscultation
bilaterally. ABDOMEN:  Rounded, positive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, no HSM or masses. EXTREMITIES:  No lower extremity
edema. NEURO EXAM: Nonfocal. SKIN: Right groin biopsy site
healed without nodularity. There are subcutaneous nodules
above and below the biopsy site as well as scattered scalp
nodules. There is a left shoulder subcutaneous nodule
measuring approximately 4 x 3 cm and a left low axillary
chest wall subcutaneously nodule measuring approximately 1
cm.

ADMISSION LABS:  WBC 10.6, hemoglobin 11.7, hematocrit 34.5,
platelet count 237,000, INR 1.2, BUN 20, creatinine 1, sodium
138, potassium 4.5, chloride 99, CO2 24, glucose 138, ALT 40,
AST 41, LDH 970, alkaline phosphatase 179, amylase 35, total
bilirubin 0.8, lipase 39, albumin 3.8, calcium 9.3,
phosphorus 3.6, magnesium 2.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent
central line placement to begin therapy. His admission weight
was 106.6 kg, and he received interleukin-II 600,000
international units per kilogram, equaling 64 million units
IV q.8h. x14 potential doses. During this week, he received
10 of 14 doses, with 1 dose held for questionable
neurotoxicity and 3 doses held due to development of
tachypnea, stridor and respiratory distress, requiring
mechanical ventilation. This event occurred in early morning
hours of treatment day #5 and he was transferred emergently
to the ICU and intubated, given stridor and tachypnea. He was
not having significant hypoxia at this time. He then became
hypotensive, requiring initiation of phenylephrine and
Levophed. At the time of his intubation, his bicarbonate was
15 and he was aggressively treated with bicarbonate
repletion. The patient was intubated x4 days and was
eventually extubated on [**1-11**]. He continued to recover
and was recovering was transferred back to the floor on
[**1-12**], where rehab was initiated. He developed
Clostridium difficile diarrhea, improved on Flagyl. He was
eventually discharged to home on [**2185-1-15**] with
physical therapy.

Other side effects during IL-2 therapy included mild chills;
development of an erythematous skin rash; nausea, improved
with lorazepam; diarrhea, improved with Lomotil, and fatigue

During this week, he developed acute renal failure with a
peak creatinine of 7.3, improved to 1.3 at the time of
discharge. He developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak
bilirubin of 7.1, improved to 1.1 upon discharge. He also
developed transaminitis with a peak ALT of 100 and peak AST
of 117, improved to within normal limits at the time of
discharge. He was anemic with hemoglobin of 7.2, improved to
11.7 after packed red blood cell transfusion. He was
thrombocytopenic with a platelet count low of 55,000, without
evidence of bleeding. As noted above, he developed metabolic
acidosis, felt to be at least partially responsible for his
respiratory failure, with a minimum bicarbonate of 14,
improved with bicarbonate repletion. He had no evidence of
coagulopathy or myocarditis. By [**2185-1-15**] he was
discharged to home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Metastatic melanoma, status post cycle
1, week 1 high-dose IL-2 complicated by respiratory failure
and acute renal failure.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lorazepam 1 mg q.4-6h. p.r.n.
nausea/vomiting, Compazine 10 mg q.6h. p.r.n.
nausea/vomiting, Proscar 5 mg daily, Flagyl 500 mg p.o.
t.i.d. oxycodone 5 to 10 mg q.4h. p.r.n. pain, Zantac 150 mg
p.o. t.i.d.

FOLLOWUP PLANS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] will be seen in clinic in 1 week
and the 2nd week of IL-2 therapy will be determined at that
time.
