- NSCLC:  s/p right upper and middle lobectomy ([**11-27**]) and wedge
resection of the left lower lobe([**3-30**]) lung nodule, recurrent
[**2-27**], s/p protocol with Navelbine and Cetuximab, started [**5-30**],
completed 6 cycles by [**10-30**]. Given dz progression started on
tarceva d/c'd in [**12-31**] due to further dz progression.
Subsequently had 2 cycles Alimta, oxaliplatin, and Avastin but
again had dz progression on imaging. ECOG protocol 2501 with
sorafenib started 03/[**2184**].
- Diabetes mellitus type 2
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia


Social History:

Physical Exam:
VS: T 97.2; BP 109/52; HR 89; RR 20: sat 89-91 % on 4L NC
Gen - Alert, no acute distress, breathing comfortably
HEENT - PERRL, extraocular motions intact, anicteric, mucous
membranes slightly dry, no lesions
Neck - no JVD, no cervical lymphadenopathy
Chest - Coarse BS bilaterally, rhonchi, decreased BS LLB, +
expiratory wheezes
CV - regular, nl S1/S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
Abd - Soft, obese, nontender, nondistended, with normoactive
bowel sounds
Back - No costovertebral angle tendernes
Extr - No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. 2+ DP pulses bilaterally

Neuro - Alert and oriented x 3, cranial nerves [**2-6**] intact,
upper and lower extremity strength 5/5 bilaterally, sensation
grossly intact
Skin - No rash
Rectal - brown; strongly guaiac positive

Pertinent Results:
[**2186-6-14**].  CTA.  IMPRESSION:  No filling defect is identified
within the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolus.
Again seen are multifocal consolidations throughout bilateral
lungs, corresponding to known bronchioalveolar cell carcinoma.
Compared to the prior CT from [**2186-5-15**], there is dramatic
increase in the extent and the  density of the consolidation
which is concerning for significant short-term disease
progression versus superimposed infection.



Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old male with NSCLC who was
admitted for post-obstructive pneumonia and dehydration
secondary to diarrhea from chemotherapy.
.
Post Obstructive PNA.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially treated in the
MICU, but was then transferred to OMED.  He was treated for
pneumonia with Unasyn in the hospital and was sent home on
Augmentin.  He was requiring 5L  NC of oxygen during the
hospitalization, which was thought to be due to lung cancer,
pneumonia and pulmonary edema after geting 5L of fluid in the
MICU.  His oxygen requirments improved with lasix.  By
discharge, he was requiring only 2LNC of oxygen.
.
Diarrhea.  He was initially admitted with diarrhea, thought to
be due to chemotherapy.  He was treated with IVF in the MICU.
His diarrhea resolved without intervention.
.
In addition, he was treated with ISS for type II DM, HCTZ,
Verpamil and Lisinopril for HTN (one hypotension from diarrhea
resolved), and Lovastatin for Hyperlipidemia.
