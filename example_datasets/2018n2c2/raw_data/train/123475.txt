Discaherge Labs;

Intra-op TEE [**2163-5-27**]
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. A left atrial
appendage thrombus cannot be excluded.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There is a dissection
flap visible originating in the aortic sinus and extending into
the distal arch at the level of the left subclavian artery.The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. AV paciong for slow
ventricular response. 3 leaflet native aortic valve with normal
movement , now with 1+ AI. MR [**Last Name (Titles) 107596**] [**12-6**]+. Preserved
biventricular systolic functiojn. Ascending aortic graft without
leak or visible dissection.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought emergently to the Operating Room on
[**2163-5-27**] for type A dissection, after initial assessment he
underwent emergent Ascending aortic/hemi-arch aorta replacement
with 30-mm Gelweave graft and resuspension of the aortic valve.
His HYPOTHERMIC CIRCULATORY ARREST TIME was 19 minutes,
cardiopulmonary bypass TIME was 131 minutes, and a CROSS-CLAMP
TIME of 76 minutes. He tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. He was supported
with pressors in the immediate post-op period, initial attempts
to wake and wean from ventilator failed due to hypoxia, his
post-op CXR was wet and he required additional diuresis prior to
extubation. during subsequent attempts to wean from ventilator
he developed atrial fibrillation, he converted to sinus rhythm
with amiodarone and Bblockers.  He was extubated on POD 3, after
which he experienced post-op delerium, which improved with
Haldol and  discontinuation of narcotics. He had cleared by the
following day and transferred from ICU to stepdown floor.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD eight the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing, pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location 1268**] in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
