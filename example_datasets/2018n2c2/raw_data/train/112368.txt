CXR [**2112-12-5**]
FINDINGS: Portable upright AP chest radiograph is obtained.
Right CP angle
is excluded thus limiting evaluation. Evaluation is also limited
by
underpenetrated technique. The lungs appear clear bilaterally.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Osseous structures
appear intact.
Left AC joint hypertrophic changes are noted.
IMPRESSION: Limited study without evidence of acute process.
Right CP angle
exclusion limits evaluation.

CXR [**2112-12-8**]
There are relatively low inspiratory volumes on this
examination. Right-sided
IJ central venous catheter remains present, with the tip
difficult to
visualize but probably at the cavoatrial junction. The cardiac
and
mediastinal silhouettes remain unchanged. Allowing for low
inspiratory
volume, no gross pulmonary consolidation is seen. No evidence of

pneumothorax. Osseous structures remain unchanged and grossly
unremarkable
aside from mild degenerative changes at the right
acromioclavicular joint.
IMPRESSION: Low inspiratory volumes; no appreciable interval
change or
evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.




Brief Hospital Course:
#. GIB: Hematemesis has been consistent with an upper GI source.
 Patient was transferred to the ICU from ED intubated for airway
protection and underwent emergent EGD, with clot in fundus that
was not unroofed, but no other sources of bleeding.  Patient
then underwent placement of a Right Internal Jugular central
line and received a total of 3 units of blood for a hematocrit
which nadered at 26. She was initially started on a protonix
drip which was changed to [**Hospital1 **] dosing of 40 mg after her HCT was
stable.  She was extubated on ICU day 2 and remained somewhat
confused and disoriented.  This was thought to be related to the
Benzodiazepines administered for sedation.  She underwent a
second EGD by GI, which found flat lesions and an ulcer in the
cardia treated with epinepherine and gold probe.  She also had
some evidence of esophagitis.  On the third ICU day, patient
remained somewhat confused, but was otherwise hemodynamically
stable and was transferred to the floor.
   On the floor, crit continued to remain stable, ranging
between 25-27.3. Pt received one additional unit pRBC on the
floor. Pt continued to remain hemodynamically stable, and was
resumed on her home HCTZ. Pt did not have any additional
episodes of melena or hemetemesis. Mental status and lethargy
cleared up and patient as alert and oriented on day of
discharge. She was continued on a high dose PPI (40mg PO bid),
and will be following up as outpt with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was removed
prior to discharge (had been maintained on the floor as pt had
poor peripheral access.) PT was consulted, and initially felt
that pt would benefit from continued PT, but upon re-eval, pt
was doing much better and will be able to go home without PT.
H.pylori is pending and will need to be followed up as
outpatient.
.
# HIV: Pt is on anti-retroviral therapy. Her last CD4 count was
488 and VL <48 as of [**7-8**]. She was continued on her HAART during
her stay (Lamivudine, Abacavir, Tenofovir, Ritonovir,
Fosamprenivir.) CD4/VL was re-checked per pt request and results
are pending, so will need to be followed up as outpt. Pt will
need to follow-up for further HIV management with her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 11528**] (appt scheduled.)
.
# HTN: Pt is on HCTZ at home. This was held on admission given
bleed. This was resumed at discharge as pt was hemodynamically
stable (systolic BPs stable in 100-130s)with no further obvious
signs of bleed on day of discharge.
.
# FEN: regular heart healthy diet. Pt was cleared by speech and
swallow evaluation for advancing as tolerated s/p extubation,
and pt was tolerating regular solids on day of discharge.
.
# PPX: Pneumoboots, PO PPI [**Hospital1 **]
.
# ACCESS: no PIVs (poor access), [**Hospital1 **] (pulled before discharge)
.
# Communication: patient
.
# Code: presumed full
.
# Dispo: discharge to home with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 702**].

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnosis: Upper GI bleed; ulcer
HIV
Anemia from acute blood loss


Discharge Condition:
hemodynamically stable, anemia stable, afebrile, tolerating PO
solids


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for uppger GI bleeding from a stomach ulcer.
You were in the ICU, and required blood transfusions.  There was
also concern of your airway from all of the bleeding, therefore
you were intubated in the ICU as well.  You were extubated and
did well.  You had an ENDOSCOPY (camera in your throat) that saw
an ulcer, which was cauterized (medication to stop the
bleeding).  Your blood counts remained stable.  You were started
on OMEPRAZOLE 40 mg TWICE DAILY to help with the bleeding ulcer.


Please take all remaining medications as prescribed. Please
AVOID NSAIDS for pain relief (e.g. Advil, Aleve, Ibuprofen),
given your recent ulcer. Please keep all scheduled appointments.


If you develop any of the following concerning symptoms, please
call your PCP or go to the ED: chest pains, shortness of breath,
fevers, chills, lightheadedness, dizziness, or blood from your
stools.

Followup Instructions:
Appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8499**]: [**2111-12-15**] 10:15 AM. Please
have him follow up on your h.pylori antibody test and CD4/Viral
load test results.
