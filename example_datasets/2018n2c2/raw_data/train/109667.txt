Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92191**] is a 39 year-old female with a history of NHL T-cell
status post mini-allo-MUD BMT in [**12/2114**] complicated by grade 1
skin GVHD now in remission, off CSA since [**6-/2115**], Prednisone
[**2-/2116**], and Cellcept [**4-/2116**], who presents from the ED with
hypotension, and fever.
*
She was recently evaluated in the Hem/[**Hospital **] clinic and a restaging
PET scan was worrisome for two new bilateral foci of increased
FDG uptake in the neck raising suspicion for recurrent FDG-avid
lymphoma. She was therefore scheduled for a CT neck with
contrast today for further evaluation. She pressented for her CT
scan to [**Hospital1 18**], and underwent the study uneventfully. Following
the procedure, she ate a hamburger with mayonnaise from the
cafeteria, and walked home. When she arrived, she developed
vague diffuse abdominal pain, then watery diarrhea X 3-4 times.
She also endorses N/V, with emesis X multiple times. Around the
same time, she also noted a new pruritic rash inside both her
ankles, which susbsequently resolved. She called EMS, who came
to her house, but for an unclear reason felt that she did not
require further care. She subsequently presented to the ED for
further evaluation. + chills and subjective fever, + flushing.
Mild dry cough over past few days. She reports a [**12-20**]-week
history of urinary frequency, no dysuria. ? Cloudy urine in past
week, with right-sided back pain. Urine culture from [**7-22**]
(hem/onc clinic) contaminated. No recent travel, no other
unusual food. She lives in a boarding home, may have been in
contact with other sick people.
*
In the ED, her initial vitals were T 104.2, HR 147, BP 91/39, RR
18, Sat 98% RA. She was hydrated with 6.5 L NS, and given
Vancomycin 1gm, Levofloxacin 500 mg IV, and Cefepime 2gm IV. She
was also given HC 100 mg IV, and Benadryl 25 mg IV. Her blood
pressure improved with the above therapy. A right IJ triple
lumen was placed in sterile conditions. She is being admitted
for further care.

EKG in ED: Sinus tachycardia, rate 129 bpm, indeterminate axis,

prior.
*
RELEVANT IMAGING DATA:
[**2116-7-24**] CXR portable: Again noted are staples from prior lung
wedge resection on the right. There are very low lung volumes.
No definite
consolidations are seen. There is platelike atelectasis at the
left lung base. The heart size is normal given technique. No
layering pleural effusions are seen.
*
[**2116-7-24**] CT NECK W/ contrast: No abnormally enlarged nodes in
the neck. The areas of increased uptake noted on PET scan could
correspond to the region of the tonsils, which appear
unremarkable on the CT scan. However, any interval change in
their size could not be assessed due to lack of prior comparable
studies.
*
[**2116-7-17**] PET SCAN: Two new bilateral foci of increased FDG
uptake in neck raising raising suspicion for recurrent FDG-avid
lymphoma. Other considerations would include granulomatous
processes and reactive lymphadenopathy. The intensity is greater
than usually seen but does not exclude reactive nodes. Recommend
correlation with history of any recent infectious symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 39 yo female with history of T-cell NHL in
remission with recent abnormal PET scan findings under further
investigation, with fever, hypotension of 12-hour duration,
responsive to IVF.
*
1) Fever, hypotension: Resolved after one night. Although her
presentation most suggestive of severe sepsis, with elevated
lactate and hypotension responsive to IVF resuscitation, the
rapid resolution was more consistent with an anaphylactic
reaction to IV contrast from the CT.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] has reported a
similar admission where the patient presented with a septic
picture which subsequently resolved without localizing a source.
Sbe was treated with the sepsis protocol and broad-spectrum
antibiotic coverage with cefepime and levofloxacin.
Hydrocortisone was given in the emergency room, so [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim
test would have been useless.
*
2) T-cell NHL in remission: Recent PET findings were concerning
for disease recurrence, although CT neck without
lymphadenopathy. Her Acyclovir and Bactrim prophylaxis were both
continued. There were no active heme/onc issues during this
admission.
*
3) ARF: Creatinine up to 1.4 on admission, decreased to normal,
suspect pre-renal physiology given elevated specific gravity and
improvement with hydration.
