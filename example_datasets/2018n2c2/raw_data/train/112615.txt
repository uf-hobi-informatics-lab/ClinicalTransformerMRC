Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Flagyl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
pneumonia, tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7756**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with dementia and benign
meningioma, presenting from [**Hospital3 2558**] with increased
productive cough, SOB and tachycardia. Patient has had one week
of increasing productive cough. She denies any chest pain,
nausea, vomiting. She is unable to provide further history about
her symptoms.
.
Of note, she was admitted from [**Date range (1) 108390**] for sinus
tachycardia and chronic cough. She was again admitted from
[**Date range (1) 33900**] for a rash that was determined to be from
metronidazole, which she was taking for Clostridium difficile
colitis, upon which she was placed on PO vancomycin, which she
was to take until [**2185-5-7**].
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 100 P 150 BP 140/84 R 20 Sat 98%
2L. Patient was noted to have wheezing on exam with crackles at
bases R>L. She was also noted to have diffuse rash on torso,
legs, and arms, documented to be from Flagyl at [**Hospital3 2558**].
CXR was concerning for RLL pneumonia, so she was given a dose of
Vancomycin and levofloxacin IV. She was also noted to have UTI.
She was given 1g of tylenol for fever. HRs improved briefly to
90s with brief conversion to NSR after IVF bolus, then converted
back to Afib with rates in 150s. She received a total of 1.5L of
IVFs in the ED. For ventricular rates intermittently in 150s,
she was then given 5mg IV lopressor which decreased HR to
110s-130s. Patient has a signed DNR form in her [**Hospital3 2558**]
records. She had also complained of some abdominal discomfort in
the ED, but on exam, she was easily distracted with no signs of
tenderness. Vitals in ED prior to transfer were as follows: HR
98 BP 115/61 RR 28 O2sat 99% 2L.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient appears comfortable and states
that her cough is much better. She complains of no chest pain or
dyspnea. She has no noted pain.
.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 96.6 BP: 114/64 P: 69 R: 27 O2: 97%RA
General: Alert, oriented x 3, no acute distress, cooperative
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: rhonchorous sounds present at the right base > left base,
presence of upper airway sounds, no accessory muscle use, no
wheezes
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: no foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema
Skin: exfoliative, erythematous rash on arms, legs and torso


Pertinent Results:
CT Chest w/o Contrast: [**2185-5-31**]
1. Bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions, with associated
dependent
atelectasis, including left lower lobe collapse, with additional
atelectasis seen dependently in the right middle lobe. There is
associated opacification of the left lower lobe bronchi, which
may reflect mucus plugging or aspiration. In the aerated lung
parenchyma, there are no focal opacities to suggest pneumonia.
2. Redemonstration of left apical lung mass, suboptimally
evaluated due to
respiratory motion, though little change from [**2184-5-21**].
3. Aortic valvular calcifications, with mild ectasia of the
ascending aorta.
4. Atrophy of the left kidney, with configuration suggesting
chronic left UPJ obstruction.
5. Moderately severe biapical pleural scarring.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis: [**2185-5-30**]
1. Bibasilar and right middle lobe atelectasis with small
bilateral pleural
effusions, new since prior imaging.
2. Resolution of the previously described pancreatitis of the
tail with a
stable 16-mm hypodense lesion which may represent either a
pseudocyst or other pancreatic cystic lesion, for example IPMN.
This could be further evaluated with MRCP.
3. Unchanged multiple fat-containing anterior abdominal wall
hernias. One
midline hernia now contains a loop of transverse colon but no
evidence for
proximal obstruction.
4. No intra-abdominal collection to account for elevated white
cell count.
.
[**2185-5-30**] RUE U/S: No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.
.
Microbiology:
UCx [**2185-5-23**] with E.coli; all blood cultures negative; repeat
urine culture negative; C.difficile negative x 2
.
**PENDING**
C-diff PCR remains pending at this time.  [**Month (only) 116**] discontinue oral
vancomycin if returns negative.  Note that pt has allergy to
flagyl.

Brief Hospital Course:
HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA: Treated with vancomycin and
cefepime x 8 day total course.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH RAPID VENTRICULAR RATE: Treated with
dilatiazem and metoprolol.  Discharge regimen was metoprolol
12.5mg po bid and diltiazem 60 mg po QID. Diltiazem may be
converted to Diltiazem XR 240 mg po q day as an outpatient.
Heart rates well-controlled when patient takes medications as
scheduled.

ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY FAILURE: Treated with IVF and improved
to 2.1-2.2 at time of discharge.

C DIFF COLITIS: Recent c diff 1 month ago.  The patient was
treated in the last month with flagyl and developed a rash, at
which time she was transitioned to PO vancomycin, which she
completed prior to this admission.  While on broad spectrum
antibiotics for HCAP above she developed a leukocytosis of 20
from 5 so she was started empirically on vancomycin oral 125mg
po q6hrs and should continue this for after she is finished with
her antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia (See below).

Aspiration: Patient noted to be frankly aspirating on [**2185-5-28**].
She was made NPO and was seen in evaluation by speech and
swallow. She had evidence of continued aspiration on three
subsequent evaluations, attributed to delirium and weakness from
prolonged hospitalization and multiple infections. In the
setting of her aspiration, elevated WBC, and findings on chest
CT she was started on an eight day course of
Piperacillin/Tazobactam for presumed aspiration pneumonia. In
discussion with her health care proxy it was decided that
parenteral nutrition or placement of a G-tube would not be in
keeping with her goals of care, and she was allowed to eat to
her comfort and desire. She was followed closely by both Speech
and Swallow and Nutrition.

Hypernatremia: While NPO for aspiration as above patient became
hypernatremic. She was treated for two days with D5W and her
sodium normalized.
