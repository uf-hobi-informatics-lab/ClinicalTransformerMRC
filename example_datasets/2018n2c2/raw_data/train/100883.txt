CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63 year old male with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post multiple
recent admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
flares, status post recent discharge from [**Hospital3 **]
[**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**5-16**], when he was intubated in
the Medicine Intensive Care Unit for a chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare.  The patient was doing well at home
according to his wife, until early in the evening of
admission when he complained of shortness of breath which did
not respond to inhalers.  The patient says he tried his
nebulizer in the bathroom as he was getting more short of
breath.  It did not help.  He then took a shower and felt
more short of breath after that.  The patient called 911.  He
was intubated in the field for air movement and respiratory
distress, with minimal breath sounds reported and somnolence,
however, his oxygen saturation was 90 percent on room air.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially
started on a Propofol drip which dropped his dropped his
blood pressure from 167/104 to the 90s.  He was then given
approximately 5 liters of intravenous fluids.  He also
received Solu-Medrol and Levofloxacin.  In the Emergency
Department, a femoral line was placed, given his low blood
pressure and he was started on Dopamine for the hypotension.
The patient arrived at the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stated and easily ventilated
with the ventilator.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
on 4 liters of home oxygen, status post multiple admissions
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flares, status post
multiple intubations, status post a history of tracheostomy
color.

Hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia.

Coronary artery disease, status post multiple myocardial
infarctions, most recently an NSTE myocardial infarction in
[**2102-4-6**].

Chronic low back pain, status post L1-2 laminectomy.

Steroid-induced hyperglycemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Combivent, Flovent, Lipitor,
Aspirin, Prednisone 40 on a taper, Metoprolol 25 b.i.d.,
Lisinopril 5 once a day, Calcium, Vitamin B, Colace, Percocet
and Protonix.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 28 pack year smoking
history.  He has quit.  He is married.  He has rare ethyl
alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His mother had [**Name (NI) 2481**] and asthma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 100.4, heart
rate 79, blood pressure 100/42, respiratory rate 20, oxygen
saturation 95 percent.  This was on his control at 480 by 20,
40 percent FIO2 and 5 of positive end-expiratory pressure.
General:  This was a chronically ill-appearing gentleman.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  He had edematous sclera.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes
were dry.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm, normal S1,
tachycardiac.  Lungs:  Essentially clear to auscultation with
occasional rhonchi.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities were
without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  There was a right
femoral line in place.  The patient was sedated and
intubated.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count was 11.8, hematocrit
40.9, platelets 228, INR 1.1, urinalysis was negative for
infection.  Sodium was 138, potassium 4.0, bicarbonate 27,
BUN 28, creatinine 1, glucose 187.  Blood gas after
intubation 7.23, 74, 476.  Lactate was 2.4.  Chest x-ray
showed the endotracheal tube in good position, tortuous
aorta, emphysematous changes with no evidence of pneumonia or
failure.  An electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardiac at 130
without any acute ST changes with enlarged P waves in 2, 3
and AVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease/respiratory failure - The patient carries the
diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with
multiple admissions and intubations, all of which seemed to
resolve rather quickly once the patient was intubated.  This
one was similar.  Within 24 hours after admission the patient
was easily extubated and did quite well after that, making
great improvement, back to his baseline within two days.  It
was felt that this is not consistent with either an asthma
attack or a true chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation or infection.  There is concern that some other
process was causing the patient's acute episodes of shortness
of breath.  In fact, it is not clear the extent of his
respiratory distress when he was intubated in the field,
initially even though he was oxygenating well and had poor
breath sounds at baseline.  The patient was treated with high-
dose steroids initially as well as q. 4 hour nebulizer
inhalers.  However, his lungs have been clear almost
immediately upon admission.  Because of concern that there
might be airway collapse contributing, the patient underwent
a computerized tomography scan which was designed to look for
tracheomalacia.  The computerized tomography scan was
misprotocoled and this could not be evaluated.  There was a
suspicion that there might be left main stem bronchus
collapse during expiration and it was read as probable distal
tracheomalacia.  The patient was provided with a BiPAP
machine and teaching.  He responded very well to this at
nighttime.  It was suggested that he use the BiPAP at
nighttime and as needed when he feels short of breath and his
shortness of breath is not helped by his usual nebulizers.
The hope is that this might prevent him from needing to call
911 and from repeated intubations.  The patient did receive
one dose of Levofloxacin, however, there is no sign of
infection and this antibiotic was discontinued.

Hypotension - The patient was initially hypotensive in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  This was after receiving Propofol and then other
sedating medications.  He required pressors briefly for
Dopamine which increased his heart rate and made him
tachycardiac.  He was then switched to Levophed.  It was felt
this was all in the setting of sedating medications as well
as ventilator positive end-expiratory pressure as the patient
did not actually appear septic at any time, he has had all of
that quite well and was normotensive once he was extubated,
in fact, on discharge he was restarted on his blood pressure
medications.

Hypertension - The patient has hypertension as an outpatient
at baseline.  His Metoprolol and ACE inhibitor were held.
Initially they were restarted on the day of discharge.

Coronary artery disease - The patient has a coronary artery
disease history.  He was continued on his Aspirin and his
Lipitor during the admission.  In the setting of hypotension,
he did have some hyperacute T waves on electrocardiogram.
His enzymes were cycled and they were negative for
infarction.  As noted, his Metoprolol and ACE inhibitor were
restarted prior to discharge.

Renal failure - Initially the patient presented with elevated
lactate and slightly elevated creatinine but these corrected
quickly with fluids.

Prophylaxis - The patient was continued on a proton pump
inhibitors as well as with heparin subcutaneously while in
the hospital.  He was then ambulatory by the day of
discharge.

Code status - The patient confirmed that he is a full code.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to home with his
usual services.  He will also be provided with a BiPAP
machine for use as described above.  The patient should
follow up with both his primary care physician and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 575**] within the next one to two weeks.
