Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea+vomiting

upper endoscopy
Dobutamine Stress Echo
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
38yo man with type I DM, CKD (baseline Cr 2.2-2.6, systolic and
diastolic CHF with EF 50-55%, refractory HTN and gastroparesis
with recurrent admissions for gastroparesis presented to new
PCP's office with recurrent nausea, vomiting, inability to take
pos and chest pain radiating to his back and was sent to ED. He
was last admitted 2 weeks ago with similar sx other than chest
pain, and was admitted for PNA and C. Diff. He states that he
has had abdominal pain and nausea/ vomiting over last week
similar to previous bouts of gastroparesis. He denies missing
any insulin doses and says he has been taking 10U at night, 4U
in evening with sugars <200 almost always. He finished [**Last Name (un) 8692**]
flagyl course, and had not had any diarrhea other than 1 episode
this AM.

In ED, initial vitals were significant for BP 250/140 and
glucose of 700 and a anion gap of 18 when corrected for
hyperglycemia. Pt. had CT without contrast to assess for
dissection given chest pain radiating to his back which was
negative. No leukocytosis, CXR and U/A negative, blood cx.
pending. He was placed on insulin gtt and received 40mg
labetalol with improvement of his BPs and resolution of his
chest pain. Initially, was to be sent to ICU, however no beds
available. As his sugars improved with insulin gtt and his his
AG closed, he is now admitted to the floor after transitioning
off insulin gtt since 3AM. He received 6U NPH 2h prior to
transfer and was actually hypoglycemic necessitating D50 X 1.

His ROS is significant for lack of cough. + CP, but
non-exertional, with no radiation and associated with abdominal
pain. No shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, LE edema. No
fevers or chills, though currently feels cold.

opacity involving the right upper lobe, predominantly its
anterior and apical segments, new. The lungs are otherwise
clear, with no pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette and pulmonary vessels are unchanged.
.
ECG: NSR with ST elevations ~ 1mm in V1-V3 c/w early
repolarization changes in anterior leads, V1 similar to
previous, v2-v3, sl. increased from priors.



Brief Hospital Course:
38yo type I diabetic with gastroparesis presents with chronic
sx. and DKA likely [**12-30**] medication nonadherence. Pt c/o chest
pain and found to have significant esophagitis. Then with acute
renal failure after cardiac catheterization to further
characterize chest pain (no significant CAD). Cr returned
towards baseline. Compliance with treatment plan and
appointments continues to be challenging and although patient
frustrated with his long hospital stay, he does not take active
role in his health care.

DKA: The patient originally presented with hyperglycemia.  No
evidence of ketones or acidosis.  He did have an anion gap with
closed quickly with IVFs and insulin gtt.  He was quickly
transitioned to SQ insulin.  There was no evidence of infection.
His blood sugars were difficult to control throughout his
hosptital stay in part because he was frequently NPO for
proceedures. He was followed by the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes consult
service. He was treated with NPH and a gentle SSI. Discharging
him with NPH and a sliding scale was discussed, but the patient
noted that he was legally blind and only able to read his
Innolet disc and would not be able to draw up syringes. He will
f/u with [**Last Name (un) **].
.
Hypoglycemia/Hypothermia: after receiving full insulin dose
while NPO and undergoing stress test, the patient experienced an
episode of hypoglycemia, confusion, diaphoresis, hypothermia to
91.9 and sinus bradycardia. He was transferred briefly to the
ICU for monitoring, but once his glucose was corrected, the
other issues also resolved shortly thereafter. He was
transferred back to the floor the following day.
.
N/V/abd pain:  This was thought secondary to his known
gastroparesis and was similar in nature to his prior episodes.
He was started on RTC antiemetics and pain control as needed. He
was transitioned from IV to PO dilauded. It was difficult to
assess his abd pain as it was both LUQ, epigastric and
substernal and radiated to the left shoulder. CT abd in the ED
showed a thickend esophagus. He was evaluated with an EGD which
showed severe esophagitis, gastritis and a soft food bezoar all
of which were though to be due to gastroparesis and reflux. His
antacid regimen was increased to PPI [**Hospital1 **]. He was also placed on
a liquid diet to facilitate the resolution of the bezoar and
improve his gastroparesis. H.pylori serology was negative.
Pathology showed---Per GI consult recomendation, erythmocyin was
stopped as PO erythromycin has no effect on gastroparesis and as
IV erythromycin has limited effect due to tachyphylaxis. In
addition, there was a concern for risk of prolonged QT when he
became bradycardic.
.
Chest Pain: In the ED, a CT was negative for dissection.  He was
ruled out by cardiac enzymes.  He was seen by cardiology on the
floor who felt that given his numerous risk factors he should
have a stress test.  Given his baseline abnormal EKG a stress
MIBI was performed, during which he had chest pain - although he
had CP prior,during and after the test as well.  At level of
exercise achieved (only 37% of age-predicted maximum), there
were no myocardial perfusion defects, however, depressed LVEF
(38%) and global hypokinesis. He then received a dobutamine
echo. The patient received intravenous dobutamine beginning at
15 mcg/kg/min. The blood pressure response to stress was
abnormal/mildly hypertensive. Resting images demonstrated
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the posterior wall. At low dose dobutamine [15mcg/kg/min;
heart rate 68 bpm, blood pressure 210/100 mmHg), there was
global hypokinesis and no reduction of cavity size; however,
there was also concerning LV ballooning and inducible ishemia.
Because of these results, he was thought to be high cardiac risk
and was kept in house for cardic catheterization. The
significiant risk of kidney failure and life-long dialysis was
discussed prior to cardiac catheterization. The patient decided
to undergo the risk with full informed consent. Cardiac
catheterization did not demonstrate significant coronary artery
disease. He was medically managed with ASA,BB,[**Last Name (un) **], statin and
his medication doses were adjusted as indicated. EGD
demonstrated signficiant esophagitis and this was thought to be
the cause of his chest pain. Given a h/o allergy to lidocaine,
he did not receive magic mouthwash and was started on
sucralfate. He will f/u with GI. His PPI was changed to
ranitidine [**12-30**] ?effect on his acute renal failure.
.
Anemia: He has a baseline anemia due to CKD. The patient
reported that just prior to moving his care to [**Location (un) 86**] that Epo
shots had been started where not currently being administered.
Two days after EGD his HCT dropped from 32 to 28 to 27. His HCT
remained stable at 28 and then rose again. He was guiac
negative, but it is most likely that he had some mild GI
bleeding. Because of the this HCT drop and because
anticoagulants are given during cardiac cath, cardiac cath was
defered until his HCT stabilized. Pt was then started on Procrit
and will receive weekly injections.
.
HTN: Uncontrolled while hospitalized, partly because not
tolerating all of his PO medications at the begining of his
hospital course.  His valsartan and BB were uptitrated to
achieve better control but valsartan was again decreased [**12-30**]
renal failure. His beta-blocker was limited by bradycardia in
the ICU and then HR 60-70 on the floor. Clonidine was started
and he will take this in patch form.
.
Acute on chronic renal failure: The creatinine remained at
baseline 2-2.4 throughout his hospital course but day after
catheterization and after having received adquate hydration,
sodium bicarbonate and mucomyst pt's creatinine jumped to peak
3.3.  IT weas thought to be secondary to contraste dye versus
his PPI has he had high eosinophilia. He was changed back to
ranitidine. He was seen by the renal consult team and will see
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] as outpatient.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnosis:
Type I DM
DKA
Mild GI bleeding due to gastritis
Hypertension
Gastroparesis
Esophagitis
Gastritis
Cardiomyopathy


Discharge Condition:
Stable; improved blood sugar, blood pressure, tolerating POs.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with nausea, vomiting and
abdominal pain which was thought to be secondary to your
gastroparesis, esophagitis and gastritis. You had biopsies taken
of your esophagus and stomach. It is important that you see a
gastroenterologist to follow up on these results.  We increased
your doses of anti-acid medication to treat the esophagitis and
gastritis. We gave you nausea medication and pain medication and
your symptoms improved but did not completely resolve. You
should eat small frequent meals with a low residual diet. It
will take some time for your nausea and pain to go away as the
gastritis resolves.
.
You also had chest pain while you were hospitalized.  Your blood
work and EKG's were normal but because you have risk factors for
heart disease a stress test was performed.  It showed that you
heart has a decreased ability to pump. Cardiac catheterization
was negative for significant disease.
.
You had acute kidney failure and were seen by the kidney
specialists. This was thought to be secondary to medication
effect (pantoprazole) and possibly the cardiac catheterization
dye.
.
Some medication changes were made to better control you blood
sugar, blood pressure and cardiac risk factors. You should stop
taking Erythromycin. Please follow the medications as directed.
.
Please have the VNA draw a lab to check your creatinine next
week. You do not need to go to the lab unless the VNA is unable
to draw them.
.
PLEASE MAKE ALL APPOINTMENTS SCHEDULED FOR YOU. You have many
medical appointments to follow but if you do not keep these
appointments you will likely end up back in the hospital.  Your
health is very important and is a full time job and we will help
you coordinate your care.
.
Please return to the ER for inability to keep food down, chest
pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or high blood sugars.
If you have blood in your stool or vomit, you should return to
the emergency room.

Followup Instructions:
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] (renal). ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 817**]. They will need to contact
you or you contact them. [**Name2 (NI) **] should see him next week.
