History of Present Illness:
79 year old male with known coronary artery disease s/p cypher
stent to RCA in [**2098**] who has been complaining of chronic angina
with minimal exertion. In addition, notes difficulty breathing,
severe fatigue and chest pressure with light ADLs, such as
showering and picking up leaves. Despite maximal medical therapy
he is still complaining of recurrent angina and was referred for
elective catheterization. Catheterization revealed diffuse left
anterior descending narrowing with new narrowing at branching of
ostium which is not amenable to stenting without stenting over
circumflex. He presents today for surgical evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
[**2107-6-3**] Echo: PREBYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits).
POSTBYPASS: There is preserved biventricular systolic function.
The study is otherwise unchanged from the prebypass period.

[**6-8**] CXR: The lungs are low in volume but clear. The cardiac
silhouette is enlarged. The mediastinal silhouette and hilar
contours are normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
present. Sternal wires are intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and was brought to the operating room
for coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Please see operative
report for surgical details. He received cefazolin for
perioperative antibiotics and was transferred to the intensive
care unit for post operative management.  That evening he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was
extubated without complications.  On post-op day one he was
started on beta-blockers, diuretics and metformin. Later that
day he was transferred to the floor.  Physical therapy worked
with him on strength and mobility.  On post operative day two he
had episodes of nausea treated with antiemtics and then short
episode of confusion so his narcotics were stopped and he was
placed on ultram for pain management with good effect.  Due to
increased creatinine to 2.1 his lasix and metformin were
stopped, and lantus was increased for blood glucose management.
Over the next few days his creatinine peaked at 2.3 on [**6-6**] and
trended down to 1.7 at discharge.  He was resumed on lasix for
diuresiss with lower extremity edema.  Additionally he had
decreased hematocrit requiring transfusions, and restarted on
home iron.  Hematocrits were trended daily and they remained
stable.  Also his white blood cell count dropped but no fever
and differential was normal, he was pan cultured and to date
only grew on gram negative rods from sputum and was placed on
levaquin.  He continued to improve and was ready for discharge
to rehab on post operative day six to Newbridge on the [**Doctor Last Name **]
with plan for follow up wound check next week for evaluation of
right leg.
