Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**]
Chief Complaint:
renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
53 year old man with h/o AML s/p allo cord transplant (now day
+516) complicated by chronic GVHD with arthritis, BOOP, who
presented to the BMT floor from clinic with worsening renal
function(2.3) and hyperkalemia, and worsening odynophagia on
[**2185-4-20**].

On arrival to the BMT floor, as he was transitioning into the
bed, he became mom[**Name (NI) 11711**] unresponsive to verbal stimuli and
physical stimuli. No jerking movements or incontience were
noted. A code blue was called. On arrival of the code team, BP
124/80, Hr 70s, satting 100% on 5L NC. He was responsive to
verbal stimuli and answering questions appropriately. He does
not recall only seconds of the entire episode; wife notes that
his eyes were closed. 1 amp of D50, 10units regular insulin, and
abuterol nebs were given for known hyperkalemia. An EKG was
obtained which showed isolated peaked T waves. CXR showed no
interval change when accounted for technique from prior in the
day. During this time, he did experience a headache that was
located in the forhead, temples and described as a pressure /
squeeze that he has experienced with prior tension headaches.
He was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further cardiac
monitoring. During this time, he was also noted to have some
tremors in hands and legs, but this was not associated with any
loss of consciousness or loss of consciousness. These episodes
will occur for only seconds at a time and tend to occur when he
is holding objects in his hands / intention tremor. He has not
had formal workup for this, but there was no clear etiology to
this tremor (which has been present intermittently over the past
2 years) to date.
His wife also relays the presence of intermittent episodes of
unresponsiveness over the past x2 years ago at a frequency of
1-2x per week lasting only seconds at a time. This has not been
formally evaluated to date.

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary of Hospital Course: 53 year old man with h/o AML s/p
allo cord transplant (day +516 on admission) complicated by
chronic GVHD with arthritis, BOOP, who now presents to clinic
with acute on chronic renal failure. Hospital course complicated
by syncopal episode the day of admission resulting in Code Blue
and hyperkalemia, requiring brief ICU admission.

#Syncope: Patient had syncopal episode the day of admission,
where he was unresponsive for ~1 minute while lying flat.
Unclear etiology, possible due to orthostatic hypotension (noted
to have orthostatic physiology in the ICU and on the floor) vs
arrythmia vs seizure activity. Of note, (per wife), patient has
had many of these episodes recently (~2 years, ~1-2 episodes per
week). Patient denied any heralding symptoms and was not
post-ictal afterwards, but was noted to have a resting tremor in
the MICU. His history of tremor is not consistent wtih seizure
activity. It appears to be an intention tremor that gets worse
when holding on to objects and is low in amplitude while high in
frequency, bilateral and not associated with change in
consciousness or incontinence.

Noted to be hyperkalemic during the code, given amp D50 and 10 U
insulin peri-code and kayexalate in the ICU, with drop in
potassium down to 4.0 on discharge.   Neurology consulted on
patient who recommended EEG and possible midodrine or fluorinef
support. Held patient's lisinopril, but continued him on his
carvedilol 12.5 mg PO BID as this was recently decreased in the
setting of light headedness/dizziness by his cardiologist on
[**3-21**], although informed him not to take the medication if he had
any pre-syncopal symptoms. Medication can be decreased at the
discretion of his cardiologist. Patient had no further syncopal
episodes or events on telemetry in the ICU or on the floor.
Neurology was consulted who recommended an EEG, possible blood
pressure support with midodrine or fluorinef, at the discretion
of the patient's outpatient oncologist and nephrologist. Was
noted to not have any telemetry events or syncopal events while
ambulating, with appropriate increase in pulse and blood
pressure. and requested to be discharged with outpatient syncope
work-up. Outpatient TTE, EEG, carotid U/S, and holter monitering
were arranged prior to discharge.

#Acute on chronic renal failure: Noted to have mildly elevated
Cre to 2.3 in clinic the day of admission. Creatine has
fluctuated over the past two years, with several episodes of
acute renal failure while hospitalized. Followed by nephrology
as an outpatient. Per outpatient notes, etiology of CKD thought
to be [**2-14**] ATN that has not resolved, medication effect in the
setting of bactrim, voriconazole, lisinopril, or AIN. Less
likely due to AML infiltration of kidneys (very rare) or
chemotherapy. Unlikely progressive glomerular disease given
patient only has scant proteinuria. Patient has refused renal
biopsy in the past. Baseline Cre has been 1.4-2.0 over the past
few months.  Lisinopril was held. Cellcept was decreased to
[**Telephone/Fax (3) 39636**] as GFR was ~30. Oral fluid intake encouraged. Renal
failure resolved to baseline creatinine (1.9) on discharge.
Renal did not have chance to formally consult on patient since
he requested discharge, but stated informally that they had no
further recommendations as an inpatient since he was refusing
renal biopsy, and he could be accommodated very soon in renal
clinic with his current outpatient nephrologist.

#Congestive Heart Failure: Euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic on
exam. Requested TTE as outpatient. Continued home meds including
aspirin, beta-blocker. Held ACEI due to hyperkalemia.

#AML: allo SCT +519 days. counts stable. continued prophylactic
medications. Arranged to follow up with outpatient oncologist.

#Epigastric discomfort: Gastritis, likely in setting of
prednisone. Patient has tried and failed Nexium, reporting it
has not helped his gastritis for 3 months. Relieved with
protonix, which was added to med list on discharge. Can obtain
prior authorization from PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5564**].
