# IMAGING

[**5-13**] CHEST XRAY (Portable AP)
IMPRESSION: New bibasilar patchy opacities which could represent
aspiration or pneumonia.

# MICROBIOLOGY

[**5-17**] GRAM STAIN (Final [**2181-5-17**]):
      <10 PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper
respiratory
      secretions. Bacterial culture results are invalid.

[**5-13**] URINE CULTURE (Final [**2181-5-14**]):    NO GROWTH.
[**5-13**] MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2181-5-16**]):    No MRSA isolated
[**5-13**] Blood Culture, Routine: Pending

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo M with DMII, CKD, HTN, DVT, asthma, presents with
shortness of breath, wheezing, agitation, and confusion.
.
# Dyspnea: Secondary to bronchospasm from reactive airways
disease and pneumonia seen on CXR. He received albuterol
nebulizer treatments and a 3-day burst of steroids (Solu-Medrol
x 1 dose, prednisone 40mg daily x 2 doses) for his bronchospasm,
as well as broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime and
azithromycin) for HCAP. He was switched to levofloxacin upon
transfer to the floor and his symptoms continued to improve.  He
was continued on his home Advair and singulair. Satting 100% on
room air at time of discharge.
.
# Hypotension: He was briefly hypotensive in the ER in setting
of hypovolemia due to poor PO intake.  His hypotension was
fluid-responsive, and there were no further episodes of
hypotension in the ICU or on the floor.
.
# h/o DVT: Patient is on coumadin at home and presented with
supratherapeutic INR, 5.6. Coumadin was held throughout
admission and his INR was 2.6 on discharge. He will need close
monitoring of his INR in the context of taking antibiotics.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Likely pre-renal given low
urine chloride and bland urine sediment.  His creatinine
improved with hydration.
.
# Delirium: Patient was intermittently confused and agitated,
however he was generally redirectable. Likely related to
steroids, infection and starting levofloxacin. Steroids were
stopped after 3-day burst and patient has 2 doses of
levofloxacin remaining. Did not receive any sedating medications
while in-house.
.
# Elevated troponin: His troponins were elevated in the setting
of renal failure with mild CK-MB elevation that was flat.  His
EKGs were reassuring against ACS and the patient denied any
chest pain.
.
# Stage 2 ulcers: On sacrum and scrotum. Managed with frequent
cleaning and dressing changes. No evidence of infection.
.
# DM2: Patient had recent admission for hypoglycemia. Glipizide
was held while in house. His fingersticks were monitored, and he
was on insulin sliding scale while in the hospital. He
intermittently refused insulin, however, his blood glucose was
controlled in the 100s-200s.
.
# DVT Prophylaxis: Systemic anticoagulation (supratherapeutic
INR throughout admission).
.
# Communication: Has temporary guardian [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]
[**Telephone/Fax (3) 88982**]. Friend, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 30106**] (aka [**Last Name (un) **]),
was made health care proxy during this admission.
.
# Code status: Full code (discussed with patient & HCP).
