Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypercalcemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 47 year old woman who carries a diagnosis of
HTLV-associated adult T-Cell leukemia/lymphoma who presents from
routine clinic appointment with hypercalcemia, with a corrected
calcium of 15.5. She received a liter of normal saline, but no
bisphosphonate, and was subsequently admitted to the floor.
.
She was recently hospitalized from [**2103-7-11**] through [**2103-8-4**], also
for hypercalcemia with acute mental status changes, which was
attributed to progression of her hematologic malignancy.
Following IV hydration and zometa, her calcium normalized, and
she underwent treatment with [**Hospital1 **] cycle 1. Her post-chemo
course was unfortunately complicated by DIC requiring multiple
cryoprecipitate, C. dif colitis, CMV viremia, and a severe
abdominal pain requiring bowel rest with TPN. She developed a
LLL pnuemonia towards the end of her hospitalization and was
discharged on a 10 day course of levaquin in addition to home
TPN.
.
Since her discharge, Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] has been slowly regaining her
strength, noting persistent fatigue which has acutely worsened
today. She denies acute confusion or mental status changes which
accompanied her previous hypercalcemic episode. She notes no
pain or paresthesias or tetany. Her last hospitalization was
complicated by severe abdominal pain requiring bowel rest- she
remains on home TPN and has been tolerating light meals due to a
sense of fullness. She also had CXR evidence of LLL pneumonia
and had been discharged on levaquin, which she has taken. She
had also developed C.dif, and CMV viremia, which had been
maintained on PO flagyl x 14d and valganciclovir in the
outpatient setting.
.
On review of systems, the patient denies fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, malaise, rigors, abdominal pain, blood in
the stools, shortness of breath, cough, dysuria, hematuria,
paresthesias, weakness.


Past Medical History:
Stage [**Doctor First Name **] mycosis fungoides (Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, stage IV
1A) with transformation to CD-30 positive large cell lymphoma
and development of HTLV-1 Adult T-cell Leukemia Lymphoma
.
- [**10-29**]: The patient developed a pruritic, papular rash. She
was seen in the internal medicine and dermatology clinics on
several occasions and was treated with antibiotics,
triamcinolone, clobetasol, and IV triamcinolone w/ no
improvement.
- [**2100-3-12**]: Skin Bx 1: LLE: Superficial and deep perivascular
lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with perivascular and interstitial

eosinophils consistent with a hypersensitivity rxn. Scabies neg.

- [**2100-7-13**]: Skin Bx 2: Atypical superficial and deep dermal
lymphoid infiltrate containing CD30-positive cells and showing
epidermotropism. PCR analysis for the T-cell receptor gamma gene
showed two sharp bands with a migration pattern suggestive of a
clonal rearrangement.
- [**2100-8-24**]: [**Hospital **] clinic: WBC 10.6 with 57% Lymphocytes S??????zary
cells.
Immunophenotypic analysis -> expanded T-cell population with
increased CD4:CD8 ratio (15) and loss of CD7. Due to her high
count of circulating S??????zary cells, she was felt to have Stage
[**Doctor First Name 690**] mycosis fungoides.
- [**2100-9-8**] CT scan: Infiltrating, hypo-enhancing lesion in the
R. kidney (?infiltrating neoplasm vs pyelonephritis) compatible
w/ lymphomatous involvement of the kidney but was not present on
a follow-up scan on [**2101-1-21**].
- [**9-30**]: Photopheresis therapy through an indwelling central
venous catheter, placed due to poor venous access.
- [**2101-1-5**]: Skin Bx 3: CTCL with large-cell transformation.
- [**2101-1-10**]: Interferon alpha at 3M units 3x/wk given w/ with
photopheresis every other week and PUVA.
- [**2101-1-26**]: Interferon alpha increased to 6Munits 3x/wk; PUVA was
d/ced [**12-26**] side effects.
- [**2101-2-23**]: Interferon alpha decreased to 4.5Munits 3x/wk on
[**2101-2-23**] b/c fatigued. Photopheresis was d/ced when catheter
removed due to a line infection (last treatment [**2101-3-10**]).
- [**2101-8-4**]: The patient presented for a follow-up evaluation with
clear evidence of disease progression. Interferon alpha was
increased to 6M units three times weekly and bexarotene was
started at 150mg daily, decreased to 75mg daily due to poor
tolerability.
- [**2101-8-25**]: Mtx added to interferon alpha and bexarotene and the
dose was up-titrated to 45mg weekly.
- [**2101-10-18**]: Hospital admission for severe lower extremity pain
at the site of new, large, papular skin lesions. Biopsy showed
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with large cell transformation,
involving the panniculus with an unusual angiocentric pattern.
The patient was prescribed vorinostat 400mg daily (started
[**2101-10-27**]) with continuation of interferon alpha 6M units TIW. Due
to thrombocytopenia, interferon alpha was decreased to 3M units
3x/wk.
- [**2101-12-22**]: Cycle 1 Day 1 liposomal doxorubicin plus gemcitabine.

Vorinostat and interferon alpha were d/ced. Side Effect: severe
palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia [**12-26**] to liposomal doxorubicin.

- [**2102-1-17**]: Cycle 1 Day 1 bortezomib plus gemcitabine,
dose-reduced during Cycle 2 due to neutropenia.
- [**2102-2-9**] 3M units TIW Interferon alpha restarted
- [**2102-3-9**]: Due to the observation that peripheral T-cells
contained floret-like nuclei, immunophenotypic analysis was
performed on peripheral blood, revealing findings consistent
with involvement by patient's known T cell lymphoproliferative
disorder as well as CD25 co-expression in a significant
population of the neoplastic CD3+ lymphocytes, suggesting a
diagnosis of HTLV-1 associated lymphoma. PCR for HTLV-1 DNA was
positive.
- [**2102-5-26**]: Following a treatment break, the patient was started
on pentostatin 4mg/m2 weekly x4 doses with reinitiation of
interferon alpha at 3Munits 3x/wkly , increased to 3M
units 5x/wkly. She d/ced therapy after 2 cycles in [**7-2**] in favor
of a Chinese herbal preparation she received in [**Location (un) 4708**].
- [**2102-8-18**]: Evaluation in the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 3242**] clinic: good candidate
for allo SCT.
- [**2102-9-26**]: CT scan: s/p 3 mo off therapy: stable to improved
disease: lymph nodes in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, are
stable to decreased in size since [**2102-7-28**], with no new pathologic
LAD identified. Decreased size of the previously enlarged
spleen, now within normal limits in size.
- [**2102-12-25**] Initiation of ONTAK therapy Cycle 1 [**2102-12-25**], Cycle 2
[**2103-1-15**], Cycle 3 [**2103-2-5**], Cycle 4 [**2103-2-26**], Cycle 5
[**2103-6-4**], Cycle 6 [**2103-7-2**]
- [**2103-4-26**]: 2 weeks of total skin electron beam therapy at the
[**Hospital3 2358**] under the care of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3403**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Therapy was held

[**2103-5-18**] through [**2103-5-24**] [**12-26**] fatigue. She received a single dose
on Friday [**2103-5-25**].
- [**2103-5-29**]: Hypercalcemia: IVF and Zometa.
- [**2103-5-29**]: Treatment Discussion: Re: Total Skin Electron Beam
Therapy: Progressive Disease and Difficulty tolerating therapy.
Decision to resume ONTAK therapy with intention of initiating
auto-transplant as she demonstrates response.
-[**2103-7-11**]: admitted for AMS in the setting of hypercalcemia,
which was thought to be due to progression of ATLL. Started
[**Hospital1 **] [**7-11**], complicated by c dif, CMV viremia, DIC.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2103-8-12**]: Cardiac size is normal. ET tube tip is in a
standard position 3.8 cm above the carina. Right PICC tip is in
the mid SVC. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the proximal
SVC. There is no pneumothorax. New bibasilar opacities, left
greater than right, are a combination of pleural effusions and
atelectasis. Superimposed infection on the left cannot be
totally excluded.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.
.
HEAD MRI [**2103-8-12**]:
FINDINGS: There is mild prominence of sulci and ventricles
inappropriate for patient's age. There is no midline shift or
mass effect. There is no hydrocephalus. There is no acute
infarct seen on diffusion images. Following gadolinium, there is
no abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement
identified. In particular, there is no leptomeningeal
enhancement seen.
Soft tissue changes are visualized in the paranasal sinuses due
to mucosal thickening. Diffuse low signal is identified within
the bony structures,
which could be secondary to marrow hyperplasia. It should be
noted that on
FLAIR images, increased signal identified at the sulci at the
convexity is
secondary to these images were obtained following gadolinium.
IMPRESSION: No acute infarcts or enhancing brain lesions are
identified. No mass effect or hydrocephalus. Other findings as
described above.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN [**2103-8-12**]:
NG tube tip is in the stomach. There is no evidence of bowel
obstruction.
Nondistended air-filled large bowel loops are seen. There are no
pathologic intraabdominal calcifications.
.
CT Torso: [**2103-8-27**]
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Interval development of right middle upper lobe airspace
consolidation
most consistent with pneumonia, with additional focus of opacity
in the left perihilar region, possibly representing additional
focus of infection,
although enlargement of left hilar lymph nodes is difficult to
exclude.
Followup imaging following treatment to ensure resolution is
recommended.
3. Splenomegaly.
4. Retroperitoneal adenopathy, grossly stable from [**2103-6-24**].
5. No intra-abdominal explanation for fever. Colon is diffusely
fluid-filled but thin-walled and without associated inflammatory
change. There is no loculated fluid collection or abscess
identified.
6. Diffuse soft tissue anasarca.
.
Bronchial Embolization: [**2103-9-4**].
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated embolization of the right bronchial
artery with
300-500 micron Embospheres until stasis was achieved.
.
CT Head [**2103-9-17**].
No acute hemorrhagic mass seen, nor large area of edema or mass
effect on non-contrast head CT. However, for evaluation of
subtle process,
MRI before and after IV gadolinium would be recommended for more
sensitive
evaluation.
.
Peripheral Blood Analysis:
Flow Analysis:
INTERPRETATION
More than 99% of the peripheral blood lymphocytes are
CD4-positive subset with co-expression of CD3, CD2, CD5.  They
have loss of expression of CD7.  About half of these T-cells
also express CD25.  These immunophenotypic findings and the
presence of "floret-like cells" in peripheral blood smear are
consistent with involvement by patient's known "Adult T cell
leukemia/lymphoma".

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] was a 47 year old lady with a diagnosis of
HTLV-1 associated Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma who initially
presented with hyerpcalcemia.  Her hospital course was
complicated by Mental Status changes which after ICE therapy
necessitating an admission to the ICU without any acute evidence
of an intracranial process. Her hospital course at this time was
also complicated by persistent ATLL, hypercalcemia, renal
tubular acidosis, acute renal failure, C. Diff colitis, and CMV
viremia.  Subsequently she developed hypoxic respiratory failure
secondary to invasive aspergillosis with pulmonary hemorrhage.
She underwent a pulmonary embolization procedure and a second
intubation and ICU stay.  Upon returning to the floor, no
additional therapeutic intervention was started for her ATLL.
Her mental status continued to deteroirate, and she stopped
taking PO.  Due to disease progression in addition to a
persistent fungal infection and concern for aspiration goals of
care were discussed with her family.  Due to her poor prognosis,
she was made DNR/DNI, and subsequently CMO.  She passed
peacefully on [**2103-9-23**].
