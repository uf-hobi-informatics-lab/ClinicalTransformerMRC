STUDIES:
[**2121-8-7**] EKG: NSR, prolonged av-conduction, no STE/STD.
.
[**7-28**] TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve shows
characteristic rheumatic deformity with fused commissures and
tethering of leaflet motion. There is moderate mitral stenosis.
Due to co-existing aortic regurgitation, the pressure half-time
estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of true
mitral valve area. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 F h/o afib, htn, AVR/MVR, presented with 3 day history of
melena, elevated INR, stable hct, transferred from MICU to
medicine service.
.
# GIB - To evaluate her GI bleeding, an EGD and colonoscopy were
performed. Colonoscopy clear. EGD shows antral erosions. H.
pylori studies were negative. Anticoag risk: bigger cardiac/CVA
risk of not anticoagulating, compared to anticoagulation risk
for GIB. She was put on a planned course of [**Hospital1 **] PPI for one
month, and daily PPI thereafter. She was bridged back to
coumadin with a heparin drip, a process which took considerable
time.
.
# HTN: held ACE and BB for concern for possible new bleeding and
risk for hypotension, monitored closely. Normotensive with
regular rate in the hospital, and did not restart these
medicines in the hospital or on discharge.
.
## Mechanical heart valve: Was on heparin bridge while off
coumadin in preparation for procedure, and until therapeutic
after EGD/[**Last Name (un) **]. This latter heparin to coumadin bridge took
considerable time and was the main reason for the length of her
admission. She was discharged with an INR of 2.6.
.
#FEN: Heart healthy diet after [**Last Name (un) 12964**].
.
#PPx:
Heparin/coumadin, as above; PPI, as above.
.
#CODE: FULL
.
#DISPO: to home once INR >2.5
#COMM: With patient and family. Main family contact: daughter

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
GI bleed secondary to supratherapeutic INR and antral erosions.


Discharge Condition:
Good


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having
bleeding in your gastrointestinal system. The doctors performed
two [**Name5 (PTitle) 12964**]; one looked inside your large intestine, and the
other looked inside your stomach. The study that looked inside
your stomach showed that there were some spots in your stomach
lining that had eroded away, and were bleeding.
.
You have been taking coumadin (also called warfarin), a
blood-thinning medicine that is important for you because you
have mechanical heart valves. Coumadin helps to prevent strokes
in people with these heart valves. But coumadin can also make it
easier to bleed. It is likely that with too high a coumadin
level, the erosions in your stomach bled more than they would
have otherwise.
.
You should continue to take the coumadin, and to get your blood
checked regularly. Your doctor or nurse may need to change the
dosage in order to make sure the coumadin level is correct.
.
Sometimes leafy green vegetables can lower your coumadin level.
If eating leafy green vegetables is important in your diet, talk
to your doctor about trying to find ways that you can eat your
vegetables and have a stable coumadin level. For now, avoid
leafy green vegetables like kale and collard greens until you
can discuss this with your doctor.

Followup Instructions:
Make an appointment with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] as soon as possible-- they
need to check your blood levels of Coumadin, the blood thinner.
Make an appointment with the gastrointestinal clinic for one
month from now.
