Chief Complaint:
bright red blood per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with a pmh of a-fib on coumadin, and dCHF who began
having crampy abdominal pain last night and BRBPR starting at
11pm. He described the pain as diffuse, crampy abdominal pain,
not worse in any particular area, and bright red blood mixed
with brown stool last night. He denies any fevers, chills, CP,
cough, dysuria, myalgias, or shortness of breath. He is a little
tired and feels "chilled" this AM. Otherwise negative review of
systems.
.
In the ED: No active bleeding was noted, his HCT dropped from
31->24 since [**2188-9-3**]. Labs also notable for INR of 3.6. His BPs
were initially 88 systolic, he got 1L NS, 2units FFP (2nd
running at transfer), no red cells, and BPs responded to around
100 systolic. EKG showed Twave flattening, he had a trop of 0.08
(baseline 0.07). GI rec'd CTA which showed diverticulosis, no
active extravasation, streak artifact from hip. There was late
phase filling in the spleen which was not thought to be a site
of active bleeding. He received vitamin K 10mg, and Protonix 40
IV. While receiving the first unit of FFP he had itching and
hives, for which he got 50mg of Benadryl which caused AMS, now
resolved. Continued FFP. 18 and 16 PIV. Transfer vitals 81
106/60 19 100% 4L. small blood around meatus.
.
On the floor, he was comfortable sitting up in bed, in no acute
distress. He is answering questions appropriately with his son
at the bedside. His only complaint is of crampy adbominal pain.
.
Review of systems:
Per HPI. All else negative

IMAGING:

CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2188-9-7**] 7:04 AM
IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without signs of acute
diverticulitis.  No CTA signs of active bleeding within the
small or large bowel lumen, though limited evaluation in the
bowel loops in the pelvis due to streak artifact from adjacent
right hip total arthroplasty.

2. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, large on the right and
moderate on the left.

3. Focal enhancement in the posterior spleen on delayed phase
images,
possible hemangioma or AV malformation.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with a pmh of a-fib and dCHF on coumadin and
aspirin who presented with a lower GI bleed in the setting of a
supratherapeutic INR.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

GI bleed: Likely due to known severe diverticulosis, exacerbated
by supratherapeutic INR from coumadin, as well as being on
aspirin.  Source is most likely lower given BRBPR mixed with
stool. However, his BUN/Cr ratio was elevated, though this
relationship has been present in historical blood draws. He was
given FFP and 10 mg Vitamin K in the ED and subsequently sent to
the MICU. He had a maroon bowel movement x1 in the MICU and
received 2 units PRBCs with an appropriate increase. CTA showed
diverticulosis with no signs of active bleeding.  His vitals and
hematocrit remained stable, no further episodes of bloody bowel
movements.  The patient was offered colonoscopy, however upon
discussion with his son, he decided that he would rather not
undergo the procedure.  Given that he was medically stable and
his bleed was likely due to diverticulosis in the setting of
supratherapeutic INR, this seemed a perfectly reasonable choice.
 He was warned, however, that the CTA could not adequately rule
out other sources of bleeding such as AVM or new malignancy that
has evolved since last colonoscopy in [**2178**] (though this is
unlikely).  He should follow up with his PCP as an outpatient to
have hematocrit checked and ensure that he is no longer having
blood in his BMs.

Atrial fibrillation: Has a history of a-fib, and has been on
coumadin since [**2185**] (CHADS2 score is 2). Mildly supratherapeutic
INR to 3.6 in ED. In setting of LGIB, INR was reversed with
vitamin K and FFP.  Coumadin held while inpatient, continued
rate control w metoprolol. The patient was instructed to not
restart the coumadin until his follow up with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] he will
need to discuss with him the risks/benefits of continuing
coumadin in the the setting of GI bleed.

INACTIVE ISSUES:

Diastolic CHF, chronic: Appeared euvolemic with a stable right
sided pleural effusion. Given GI bleed, lasix, lisinopril
(recently DC'd) and metoprolol were initially held.  Metoprolol
restarted at half dose, lasix and lisinopril were not restarted
on discharge.  Defer decision on restarting to PCP.

TRANSFER OF CARE ISSUES:
- GI bleed: recheck hgb/hct as outpatient, consider outpatient
colonoscopy if patient continues to have blood w his BMs
- Coumadin:  assess risks and benefits prior to restarting.
Because his INR was reversed and coumadin stopped, he will need
heparin bridging if he is to restart therapy.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 101773**],

You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] because of bleeding with your
stool. You required transfusions of blood and blood products.
You had a high INR - or coumadin level. We believe that this INR
contributed to the bleeding but the [**Last Name **] problem was likely in
the colon, possibly diverticulosis. We discussed the risks and
benefits of a colonoscopy and ultimately you decided to discuss
this with your regular doctors.

Moving forward, we ask you to do the following:
1. STOP Coumadin
2. STOP Lisinopril
3. REDUCE the dose of your Metoprolol to a HALF pill twice daily
(12.5 mg)
4. STOP Lasix (at least until your primary care appointment)

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.
