ADDENDUM:  While on the floor, the patient developed
hypotension and diaphoresis.  A code was called.  The patient
was intubated and taken to the unit.  At that point, the
patient put out melenic stools.  A NG tube was dropped with
coffee ground.  The patient's hematocrit stabilized and she
was not scoped.  Her GI bleed was felt to be related to the
aspirin, Plavix, plus Relafen.  All three medications were
held.  The patient experienced a left pneumothorax during
left subclavian line attempt.  She did not require a chest
tube and the pneumothorax is resolving on its own.

The patient was restarted on aspirin and Protonix.  During
this episode of hypotension, systolic to the 80s, the
patient's stroke progressed as evidenced by MRI and further
weakness in her left arm and loss of gag reflex.  In
addition, she experienced a non ST elevation MI, felt to be
related to demand ischemia.  Peak CK was 323, peak troponin
31.0.  The patient was extubated without difficulty and
called out to the floor.

Her systolic blood pressures were maintained by holding
antihypertensives with the exception of a beta blocker.  For
the loss of her gag reflex, the patient was kept n.p.o. and
started on tube feeds via NG tube.  A PEG was placed by
Interventional Radiology on [**2176-7-17**].  The Stroke Team
reevaluated the patient and felt that she would not tolerate
further anticoagulation necessary for carotid stent
placement.  They will follow-up with her, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] or Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], in the stroke clinic in four to six weeks after
discharge to reconsider a carotid stent with Plavix.  The
patient developed copious secretions with her impaired
swallow mechanism and a scopolamine patch was started with
excellent effect.

Her blood sugars were difficult to control and the [**Last Name (un) **]
Team was consulted and an acceptable regimen of NPH 30 units
q.a.m. and q.h.s. with a sliding scale was deemed adequate
control.  The patient had a slightly elevated white count
prior to discharge.  Her U/A was positive with a pH of 9.0
suggesting Proteus.  Ciprofloxacin was started.  The patient
will be discharged to [**Hospital3 7**].

ADDITIONAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Loss of gag reflex secondary to cerebrovascular accident,
subsequent placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube by Interventional Radiology on [**2176-7-17**].
2.  Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
3.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed in the context of aspirin,
Plavix, and Relafen.
4.  Urinary tract infection.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atorvostatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lansoprazole 30 mg per G tube b.i.d.
5.  Scopolamine patch transdermal q. 72 hours.
6.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q. 12 hours for a 14 day
course, last dose [**2176-8-1**].
7.  Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers p.r.n.
8.  Acetaminophen p.r.n.
9.  Insulin NPH 30 units q.a.m., 30 units q.h.s.
10. Insulin sliding scale as follows:  Fingersticks 80-100
covered with 4 units; fingersticks 101-150 with 6 units;
fingersticks 151-200 with 8 units; fingersticks 201-250 to be
covered with 10 units; fingersticks 251-300 with 12 units;
fingersticks 301-350 with 14 units; fingersticks 351 to 400
with 16 units; fingersticks greater than 400 with 18 units of
regular insulin.

All the above medications may be given per NG tube.  Ideally,
the patient will be restarted on an ACE inhibitor once her
requirement for systolic blood pressure greater than 130
related to her CVA has passed.
