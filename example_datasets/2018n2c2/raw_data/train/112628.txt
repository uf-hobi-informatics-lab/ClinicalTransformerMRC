Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
intracerebral hemorrhage (transfer from [**Hospital6 204**])

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year-old right-handed man with a history of HTN
and [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with an intracranial
hemorrhage.  He woke at 3AM with severe vertigo, chest pain, and
palpable tachycardia.  He states explicitly that the chest pain
woke him from sleep.  He had a mild headache at that time, but
it
was much less intense than his other symptoms.  He remained in
bed until 5AM with little improvement to his symptoms.  He
attempted to walk to the bathroom but still suffered from severe
vertigo and fell.  He denies injury generally, and specifically
states that he did not strike his head.  After this fall he
called 911 and was transferred to [**Hospital6 204**].  CT
there demonstrated a R. basal ganglia bleed, leading him to be
transported to [**Hospital1 18**].
   Per the ER resident his symptoms have been stable from his
initial presentation at LGH until the present.  Neurosurgery
evaluated him for possible drainage in the ER and felt that no
intervention was indicated at this time.
   He notes that recent glycemic control has been very poor.  On
multiple days over the last week he has had glucoses > 400, and
his high over the last week was >600.

ROS: There have been no changes in vision or hearing, neck pain,
tinnitus, weakness, difficulty with comprehension, speaking,
language, swallowing, eating or gait. General review of systems
was negative for fevers, chills, rashes, change in weight,
energy
level or appetite, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, and change in bowel or bladder habits (i.e
incontinence).

Past Medical History:
 - HTN
 - IDDM
 - Industrial exposure to cadmium 15y ago in a workplace
     explosion
 - Failure of at least one kidney - he does not know which
 - Intermittent paralysis of L. or R. arm lasting 2-3 minutes x
     1 year, occurs multiple times per month but has not
     escalated in frequency.
 - Peripheral vascular disease
 - Gout vs. osteoarthritis, given Indomethacin treatment and
     complaint of chronic severe knee pain. Pt does not know
     distinction between these diagnoses.


Social History:
The patient lives alone, is disabled and not working secondary
to diabetes, and has one daughter.

Family History:
Little is known - all family members of his and prior
generations remained in [**Country **] and their later-life histories
are unknown.

Unchanged right parenchymal hemorrhage with extension into the
right lateral
ventricle, the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of left lateral ventricle, and the
third
ventricle. These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
9:45 on
[**2167-11-27**].


Final Report
INDICATION: Interval evaluation of known parenchymal hemorrhage.


COMPARISON: Outside hospital CT from [**2167-11-27**] at 6:41
a.m.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
brain without
intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were
prepared.

FINDINGS: Again visualized is an unchanged 2.7 x 1.7 cm right
basal ganglia
parenchymal hemorrhage extending into the right lateral
ventricle as well as
the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle and the third
ventricle. A
thin surrounding rim of edema is again noted. There is no shift
of the
normally midline structures. There are no new foci of
hemorrhage,
infarctions, mass effects, or herniation. No fractures are
identified. The
visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells,
and middle
ear cavities are clear.

IMPRESSION:
Unchanged right basal ganglia hemorrhage extension into the
right lateral
ventricle, frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle and the
third ventricle.
Location and imaging features favor hypertensive hemorrhage,
although CT
cannot entirely exclude underlying vascular malformation or
mass.
These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 9:45 on
[**2167-11-27**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.



Provisional Findings Impression: DLrc SAT [**2167-12-5**] 9:49 PM
Slight interval decrease in size of right basal ganglia
hemorrhage with little
change in known intraventricular extension. Stable size of the
ventricular
system.


Final Report
INDICATION: Patient is a 52-year-old male with known
intraventricular,
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with worsening mental status.
Evaluate for
interval change.

EXAMINATION: CT of the head without intravenous contrast.

COMPARISONS: [**2167-12-2**].

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
brain. No
intravenous contrast was administered. Multiple sequences were
attempted
secondary to patient motion.

FINDINGS:

Since the prior examination, there has been slight interval
decrease in size of a focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, now
measuring 2.2 x 1.2 cm where previously it measured up to 2.6 cm
in maximal dimension. This area of hemorrhage is centered in the
right basal ganglia and demonstrates extension into the right
lateral ventricle. Overall, there has been slight interval
decrease in hemorrhage filling the right lateral ventricle
extending into the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. The ventricular system is
stable in size and configuration, with the third ventricle
measuring up to 7 mm and the right lateral ventricle measuring
up to 10 mm. There are no new foci of hemorrhage. There is no
evidence of shift of midline structures or transtentorial or
uncal herniation. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved with no evidence of acute territorial infarction. The
bony structures are unremarkable. The visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION: Slight interval decrease in size of right basal
ganglia
hemorrhage with little change in known intraventricular
extension. Stable
size of the ventricular system. As mentioned earlier, while this
can relate to HTN, underlying vascular/neoplastic cause cannot
be excluded and work up accdgly.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
52yo man with longstanding HTN and [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with intracranial hemorrhage, suspected secondary to
hypertensive crisis.  The size of his bleed, the need for
frequent neuro checks, and his need for antihypertensives via
continuous drip necessitate ICU admission.  His Left-sided
sensory symptoms were well-explained by his Right-thalamic
bleed, and there were no symptoms that were unexplained by this
lesion. Although we do not have records of his blood pressure at
the time of EMS contact, the presumptive etiology of this
hemorrhagic infarct is uncontrolled hypertension. Renal consult
was called re. the acute-on-chronic renal failure, and
recommended discontinuing his NSAIDs (taken for ?gout), which
was done, and measuring urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, which
revealed gross proteinuria >5,000.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the floor after several days in the
ICU. Continued issues were blood glucose control (managed with
insulin sliding-scale) and acute renal failure (initially ~2.0
and steady, but then up to 2.7 in the setting of UTI and Cipro
Tx, all above a reported baseline CKD/Cr 1.5), despite IVF and
holding the patient's previous indomethacin. On the floor, he
became more confused and febrile, and was found to have a
gram-negative UTI. Initially, he was treated empirically with
ciprofloxacin, but this worsened his renal failure, and the
patient became febrile and somnolent/lethargic, so he was
switched to IV vancomycin and Zosyn (vancomycin was discontinued
[**12-7**] after UCx from [**12-5**] showed gram-positive bacteria). This
UCx ultimately speciated a pan-sensitive [**Last Name (LF) 88119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] on [**12-8**]
(day of discharge) after 3.5d of treatment with IV Zosyn, he was
switched to PO Bactrim, plan to finish a 7-8d course for
complicated (male) UTI. Fever defervesced rapidly and mental
status improved markedly 1-2d after starting IV antibiotics, and
creatinine began improving after it peaked at 2.7 the day before
discharge (down to 2.5 on [**12-8**]). Blood cultures and a repeat
UCx on [**12-5**] (after first dose of Cipro) have remained no growth
to date.

On the day of discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was alert and oriented to
place and date, with stable and normal VS. Breathing comfortably
and BP in good control on current medication regimen, HDS. On
Neurologic examination, his speech was fluent and he exhibited a
stable mild flattening of his Left NLF, but full power in all
tested muscle groups. He is working with PT and getting out of
bed to chair [**Hospital1 **]. His FSBG were in good control (120-150) on
increased dosing of SSI.

Plan:
-follow up in Neurology/[**Hospital 4038**] clinic with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] (see
discharge information)
-arrange follow-up with patient's PCP and if PCP agrees,
consider starting him with Nephrology outpatient follow-up in
the near future (chronic kidney disease and now recovering from
acute renal failure and UTI)
-finish 3.5 days more of [**Hospital1 **] Bactrim DS 1 tab PO for complicated
UTI
-continue medication regimen (excluding NSAID) as listed below

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnosis:
-Intraparenchymal hemorrhage

Secondary Diagnoses:
-Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
-Urinary tract infection (Klebsiella, pan-sensitive)
-Hypertension, uncontrolled.
-Diabetes, poorly controlled.
-Peripheral vascular disease
-Gout


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory, slowly recovering from stroke


Discharge Instructions:
You had a hemorrhagic stroke, which means that there was
bleeding in your brain. This caused the neurologic symptoms
(sensations, mild weakness) that you experienced. This was
caused by your high blood pressure along with your diabetes,
which need to be kept in better control to prevent future
strokes.

Your kidneys, which were already chronically damaged, were also
injured, at least in part due to the painkiller medicines
(indomethacin and naprosyn) that you were taking every day. This
was also related to a urinary tract infection you developed here
in the hospital, which is being treated by antibiotic medication
that will continue for 3 more days.

Followup Instructions:
(1) With Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in Vascular Neurology (stroke) clinic
on <<Tuesday, [**1-12**] at 2:00pm>> at the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] clinical
center, [**Location (un) **].

(2) With your Primary Care Provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) 138**] for appointment ASAP
