Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
right flank pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right sided thoracocentesis (-2200 mL fluid)

History of Present Illness:
55 YO female with metastatic adenocarcinoma with unknown primary
on C2D1 gemcitabine/irinotecan and with malignant pleural
effusions presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with severe R flank pain,
radiating to chest.   Patient reports pain was [**9-19**] in
severity.  She was otherwise asymptomatic, denying shortness of
breath or coughing at presentation.  She experienced R flank
pain previously for which she had applied a fentanyl patch with
adequate pain control.  Of note, she has known lytic bone
lesions to the R pelvis. She reports that she had not applied
the fentanyl patch to the R flank recently as pain control had
improved.
.
The patient's cancer initially presented as syncope and further
work-up revealed
pericardial/pleural effusion [**2181-5-10**].  The pleural fluid
revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma and the pericardial fluid a
well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. The patient has had
3 recent admissions: on [**5-16**] for dyspnea and [**6-6**] and [**6-14**] for
dizziness/syncope.  On admission [**6-6**], the patient had
pericardiocentesis and balloon pericardiotomy with removal of
520 cc of bloody fluid. [**Month/Year (2) **] on [**6-4**] showed stable loculated
pericardial effusion. [**Month/Year (2) **] [**6-11**] (EF>55%) suggestive of
pericardial constriction, although unchanged in size since prior
admission.
.
During admission on [**6-14**], cardiology team saw the patient and
recommended trial of low dose beta blocker for rate control; a
pericardial window was not performed because the effusion was
determined to be stable and symptoms thought to be related to
dehydration and tachycardia.  Subsequent CT of the torso did not
reveal a primary source but did reveal bony lytic lesions in the
right ischium and bilateral ilia concerning for metastatic
disease. She also underwent an upper and lower endoscopy without
evidence of a  primary lesion. Considering pericardial and
pleural fluid pathology, a subtle gastric or pancreatico/biliary
tumor was suspected and the patient was started on
gemcitabine/irinotecan.  Her last dose of chemotherapy was
yesterday 8/2 per patient. Chemotherapy was begun on [**2181-6-15**].
.
Pt. presented to ED with tachycardia above baseline in 130s to
140s.  Patient has h/o resting tachycardia 115-120.
Electrocardiogram in the ED showed sinus tachycardia unchanged
from prior.  Radiography showed reaccumulation of pulmonary
edema and CT of the chest showed no acute changes.  A
therapeutic thoracentesis was performed of 2200 mL of dark
maroon right pleural fluid.  In addition, after the procedure,
the patient complained of increased shortness of breath
increased from baseline, patient's O2 saturation was in the 90s.
 The patient was administered Lasix (40 mg X1) in the ED with
subsequent improvement of respiratory function.  In ED patient
was administered vancomycin 1 g, ondasetron 2 mg twice, and 4
doses of morphine sulfate 4 mg. Patient was admitt-ed to ICU for
pain control and management of tachycardia in setting of pleural
effusions.

C.dif - negative
Blood and urine cx: no growth
.
CXR ([**7-11**]):
IMPRESSION:  Increased size of now large right pleural effusion
and minimally increased now moderate left pleural effusion.
.
Chest CT ([**7-12**])
IMPRESSION:
1.  Diffuse peribronchovascular opacity with air bronchograms
involving the right middle and right lower lobes post
thoracentesis.  Given the rapid evolution of this process,
findings likely represent pulmonary edema. Pulmonary hemorrhage
or multifocal pneumonia is less likely.  Close interval
radiographic follow up recommended.
2.  Large left pleural effusion with adjacent compressive
atelectasis.
3.  Minimal pericardial fluid.
4.  No pneumothorax or reaccumulation of the right pleural
effusion.

CXR ([**7-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Unchanged moderate left-sided pleural effusion.
2.  Patchy opacities at the right lung base have cleared since
the prior
examination, likely representing pulmonary edema given its rapid
improvement;
mild persistent residual pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 55 y/o woman with metastatic adenocarcinoma of
unknown primary (likely discrete gastric or pancreaticobiliary
ca) admitted with tachycardia in the setting of malignant
pericardial effusions and uncontrolled pain.
.
# Malignant Effusion - The patient presented for outpatient
therapeutic thoracocentesis [**7-12**] (done for worsening SOB) with
removal of 2200 mL R sided fluid, followed by excruciating pain
at thoracotomy site. The dyspnea after her procedure was likely
a result of reexpansion edema, which was reflected on her chest
X-ray. She was initially treated in the intensive care unit with
oxygen therapy as well as IV Lasix and closely monitored. No
infectious etiology was identified. It was decided that
thoracentesis was not warranted as her pleural effusion was
significantly smaller after the procedure. Her respiratory
distress rapidly improved with diuresis and she was soon back to
baseline (requires home O2).
.
# Mucinous adenocarcinoma of unknown primary: The patient began
chemotherapy on [**2181-6-15**] with Gemzar and CPT-11 for metastatic
disease. She did not experience significant nausea during
hospitalization, but continued to have diarrhea related to her
chemotherapy which was treated with Lomotil.
.
# DVT/PE - She is s/p IVC filter placement on [**2181-5-30**] s/p DVT of
common femoral. She was continued on lovenox therapy.
.
# Pain - Patient had known lytic lesions, with high risk of
pathologic fracture. Bilateral hip xray on [**6-12**] demonstrated no
progression of known metastatic lesions. Orthopedics were
consulted on prior admisson and believe chemotherapy should
proceed prior to any radiation therapy to the hip. Also with
pain at site of thoracentesis. She was treated with home
fentanyl 25mcg patch for pain control, home lidocaine patch with
morphine for breakthrough pain
