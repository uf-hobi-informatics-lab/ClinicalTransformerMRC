History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 90223**] is a 85-year-old male with CAD s/p PTCA LCx
([**2092**]), HLD, AAA, PE, PAD, COPD that was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for c. cath with complicated OSH course consisting of anemia
secondary to GIB, bilateral PE not on anticoagulation, and
NSTEMI with reduction of EF, and acute systolic heart failure.
Pt is transferred to the CCU prior to cardiac cath for ASA
desensitization protocol.
.
He was admitted on [**2109-1-10**] for SOB at [**Hospital3 1443**]
Hospital (contact number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 90224**]). [**Name2 (NI) **] oximetry was in
the low 80s at home responsive to home O2 via NC. He endorses
feeling cold type symptoms with coughing for quite a few weeks
but became more dyspneic with increasing cough and clear sputum
production. Chest CT showed new bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Venous US was negative for DVT. An IVF filter was placed on
[**1-10**] in setting of inability to anti-coagulate with anemia.
Admission labs were also notable for Hgb/Hct of 6.6/24.2 and
guaiac positive stool. He was treated for a presumed GIB. He was
transfused 3 units of pRBC. Endoscopy performed on [**1-11**] was
unremarkable. Colonoscopy was attempted on [**1-10**] but unable to
be performed secondary to stool in bowel. Colonoscopy
subsequently performed on [**1-17**] showed diverticulosis and
diminutive polyp x 1, which showed fragments of adenoma.
Labs were also significant for 3 sets of elevated troponins and
CPKs. ECHO on [**1-15**] showed EF 35 % (last EF on [**2108-3-6**] showed
EF 60 %). Stress test showed large area of ischemia extending
from the anterior wall and anterior apex of inferior wall. There
was evidence of prior small lateral wall infarction with
significantly depressed LVEF. His latest CXR showed mild CHF.
Additional studies included abdominal US showing AAA that is
stable compared to prior exam on [**2108-10-4**].
Hospital course also complicated by flash pulmonary edema on
[**2109-1-12**].
The patient was also treated for pneumonia although viral URI
was favored with fever 100.2 in setting of chronic prednisone
therapy although no infiltrate noted. He was treated with
moxifloxacin 400 mg PO qD for a 10-day course. CXR did not
suggest pneumonia.
.
Pt describes an ASA allergy consisting of redness on his face,
and rash diffusely many years ago.
.
On arrival to CCU, he was afebrile, with VS HR 76, BP 106/70, RR
20, 93% 3LNC, repeated at 98%. Pt denies chest pain, chest
pressure, or SOB. He says that he has felt overall weak since he
was admitted to the OSH, but that this has gotten better.
.
On review of systems, he endorses overall weakness as above. He
says that he has had black stools for the past year, but that
the doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **]'t been able to figure out why. He states that
he went to the OSH because he knew that his [**Name5 (PTitle) **] counts were
low. He denies fever or chills, but continues mild cough with
yellow sputum.
He also endorses previous leg cramping.
He denies any prior history of stroke, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, or red stools. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  He is able to
walk 3 blocks with having to stop 2-3 times, which is unchanged
in the past year. He performs all of his ADL's and lives on his
own.

CARDIAC CATH:  prior from [**2092**] not available
[**2109-1-21**] prelim: 1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant
system demonstrated three-vessel disease. The LMCA had a distal
80% stenosis. The LAD had a 50% mid stenosis and a 50% stenosis
of D1. The LCx had a 90% mid
stenosis. The RCA was occluded proximally and filled distally
via
left-to-right collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial [**Year (4 digits) **]
pressures with SBP 106mmHg and DBP 56mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease and left main disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
NSTEMI:  Patient reported chest pain in setting of shortness of
breath, which appeared to be multifactorial. Denied any chest
pain but does endorsed shortness of breath which improved.
Complete cardiac biomarker set unavailable from outside records,
but appears had NSTEMI given biomarker elevation, EKG changes,
and decreased EF resulting in acute heart failure (60's to 30's
EF).  Nuclera stress at OSH showed large area of ischemia
extending from anterior wall and anterior apex of inferior wall
with evidence of prior small lateral wall infarction. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of cardiac catherization,
but first required aspirin desensitization as has documented
aspirin allergy.  Left cardiac ICU after aspirin
desensitization.  Cardiac catherization confirmed triple vessel
disease with RCA occlusion and LAD 80% occlusion.  Patient was
informed of necessity of coronary artery bypass, and declined
surgical intervention multiple times.  Based on patient wishes,
optimized medical management and defered surgical treatment.
* Medical management with Atorvastatin 80 mg qhs, Carvedilol
6.25 mg PO BID, ASA 325 mg PO qday, Captopril 12.5 mg TID.
* [**Month (only) 116**] want to switch short acting captopril to longer acting
lisinopril as an outpatient.

Acute systolic heart failure (last EF 35 %):
Patient developed acute systolic heart failure given EF decline
from 60 % ([**2108-3-6**]) to 35 %.  Most likely from ischemic event
as above. His dry weight in unknown, and he has experienced
weight loss in the past 3 months of about 20 lbs. At the OSH,
had flash pulmonary edema and an oxygen requirement which
resolved in house. Discharge weight steady at 140 lbs and
physical exam suggested euvolemia.
* Continued medical management with Captopril 12.5 mg PO TID,
Carvedilol 6.25 mg PO BID.  [**Month (only) 116**] want to change short acting
captopril to longer acting lisinopril as an outpatient.
* Deferred use of spironolactone as borderline hyperkalemia at
4.7.

Bilateral pulmonary embolisms, recurrent s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter
placement:  He has had second episode of pulmonary embolism in
past year. Uncertain as primary imaging report not available to
classify as segmental, subsegmental but overall did not appear
to cause hemodynamic instability at presentation. Etiology
unknown.  Given advanced age, 20-lb weight loss, and chronic
tobacco abuse, would suspect that neoplasm high on differential.
Other etiologies like immobility or recent surgery not present
to explain recurrence, and no family history of thrombosis.  Had
heparin gtt in house.  Discharged with 10 days worth of
enoxaparin injections with bridging therapy with coumadin to
treat PE.
* Follow up CBC/ Coag panel
* Discuss with patient duration of anticoagulation (life long?)
* Confirm age appropriate cancer screening on outpatient basis
per above
* consider thrombophilia work-up as outpatient
* IVC filter in place

Microcytic Anemia:  Has a history of anemia at baseline.
Admission to OSH Hct 24 and post-transfusion OSH Hct 33 status
post 3U pRBC.  At [**Hospital1 18**], Hct stable in the low to mid 30's.  [**Month (only) 116**]
have had marrow suppresion in setting of viral illness, as well
as GI [**Month (only) **] loss given history of adenomas. Hematology consult
at OSH impression was ACD vs. other process with consideration
for bone marrow biopsy as outpatient for unclear reasons. His
EPO level was elevated, which could suggest chronic hypoxemia in
setting of COPD vs. renal cell carcinoma vs. appropriate
response to anemia. Flow cytometry also not suggestive of
abnormal myeloid maturation or an increased blast population or
lymphoproliferative disorder. SPEP performed but results were
not available upon transfer.  No hypercalcemia or bony
involvement to suggest MM. He does have a history of prior GIB
in the stomach antrum. OSH Colonoscopy and EGD showed
diverticuli and polyp consistent with adenoma but no active
source of bleeding.  At [**Hospital1 18**], patient excxlaimed he has had a
20lbs weight loss, as well as night sweats a few times a week
for the last month.  Concern for malignancy, but discussion with
PCP is that he is aware of these symptoms and has performed age
appropriate screening for this patient.  Did have a history of
prostate cancer, but not complaints of bone pain at [**Hospital1 18**].
*  Need to follow-up final pathology of polyp from OSH
*  Check CBC on follow up


COPD :  Patient has long tobacco history and continues to smoke.
No evidence for active COPD exacerbation.  CXR demonstrated
diaphragmatic flattening consistent with COPD.  Discharged home
on albuterol and tiotropium.  Counseled on tobacco cessation but
patient not interested in quitting.  Additionally, at OSH was
treated with a 10-day course of avelox for low grade fever in
setting of prednisone usage with no infiltrate on CXR or CT.
* continued albuterol/tiotropium at home.
* F/u with PFT's prn

Abnormal ALT: Incidentally  patient's ALT elevated to 204 on
[**2109-1-10**] with downtrend to 51 on [**2109-1-20**]. Per OSH report
Abdominal US showed no liver pathology.  ALT on admission 204
now trended to 50s prior to discharge.
* Follow up LFT's as an outpateint

CHRONIC ISSUES
Temporal arteritis: No active issues. Continued prednisone 10mg
daily.

Weight loss
Broad differential for weight loss including depression given
prior history, poor access to food, underlying chronic illness,
and possible occult neoplasm.  Follow up per above.
*  Defer to outpatient work-up

Asymptomatic AAA:  AAA noted on OSH US significant for
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (4.5 cm x 4 cm) stable from
prior US dated [**2108-10-4**].
*  Defer to further outpatient management.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  Code status in house changed to DNR/DNI
confirmed with patient.  Should reconfirm with patient as an
outpatient and make sure power of attorney/living will paper
work is up to date.  Patient counseled on necessity of
continuing aspirin, and that if he discontinues use for even one
day may experience recurrence of allergic reaction given history
of allergy.  Patient understood necessity to take daily.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90226**],
  You originally presented to another hospital because of
shortness of breath.  There, you were found to have multiple
medical problems, including [**Name2 (NI) **] clots in your lungs as well as
evidence of a minor heart attack based on [**Name2 (NI) **] tests.
Additionally, you were found to have very low red [**Name2 (NI) **] cell
count.  You were given bags of [**Name2 (NI) **] to replete your low counts,
and placed on [**Name2 (NI) **] thinners in an attempt to treat the clots in
your lungs.  Your small heart attack affected the way your heart
could pump, and as a result the doctors at your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] hospital
suggested you come to [**Hospital1 **] for further
evaluation
  At [**Hospital1 **], you had a procedure called a cardiac catherization.
This is a procedure where a catheter is inserted in the large
vessel in your groin, and wired to the heart.  Dye was injected
to analyze the vessels in your heart, known as the coronary
arteries.  There evidence of severe coronary artery disease,
which causes the [**Hospital1 **] vessels to become blocked off.  This
finding was concering, as it increases your risk of a severe
heart attack.  Your doctors informed [**Name5 (PTitle) **] of this finding, and
suggested you have surgery known as a "Triple Bypass" surgery,
to circumvent the blocks in your coronary arteries.  However,
after you were told about the risks and benefits of having the
surgery, you decided this is not a procedure you would want
performed at this time.
  Because you declined to have the surgery, we have attempted to
medically optimize your medication regimen.  It is important to
continue to take your medications as prescribed, to help reduce
your risk of having another, larger, heart attack in the future.

  Additionally, you have been placed on medication to treat the
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] clots in your lungs.  The first medication is called
"Lovenox" or "Enoxaparin".  It is injection you give yourself
twice a day.  The second drug is called "Warfarin" or
"Coumadin".  It is a pill you will take to help keep your blodo
thin.  As warfarin takes some time to work, it is important you
take enoxaparin in the interim to help keep your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] thin
while warfarin starts to work in your body.  Please use the
enoxaparin injections for 10 days or as arranged by your PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is unclear why your red [**Name10 (NameIs) **] cell count was low when you
came to the hospital.  It is importnat you follow up with your
primary care doctor for further evaluation of this issue.

The following is your NEW LIST of medications.  Please
discontinue taking any medications that are not on this list,
and adhere to the medication dosing.

Your were "desensitzed" to Aspirin, this means that if you
continue to take it everyday you will not have an allergy to it.
 HOWEVER if you miss even a single dose please call your PCP to
discuss whether or not he wants you to take the next dose BEFORE
you take it.

Acetaminophen  325 mg Tablet 1 Tablet by mouth every 6 hours as
needed for pain.
Carvedilol  3.125 mg Tablet 2 Tablets by mouth [**Hospital1 **] 2 times a day
Warfarin  1 mg Tablet 3 Tablets by mouth once Daily at 4 PM.
Captopril  12.5 mg Tablet 1 Tablet by mouth three times a day.
Atorvastatin  80 mg Tablet 1 Tablet by mouth at night
Prednisone  5 mg Tablet 2 Tablet by mouth DAILY
Aspirin  325 mg Tablet 1 tablet by mouth daily
Omeprazole 20 mg tablet 1 tablet by mouth daily
Albuterol sulfate  90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler
 1 Inhalation as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Tiotropium bromide  18 mcg Capsule, w/Inhalation Device
 1 Inhalation at bedtime.
Enoxaparin 60 mcg 1 injection 2x a day for 10 days
Nitroprusside 0.4 sublingual as needed for chest pain

It has been a pleasure taking care of you Mr. [**Known lastname 90226**]!

Followup Instructions:
It is very important that you see your PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 357**] arrange for
follow up within the week.  They can be reached at:

Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] KO
#[**Telephone/Fax (1) 39260**]

Additionally, it is importnat that you follow up with your
cardiologist within the month for discussion of your cardiac
issues.  Please call your cardiologist and arrange for follow
up.
