Elevated LFTs

[**2150-1-22**] cholangiogram with liver biopsy
[**2150-1-29**] liver biopsy

History of Present Illness:
62yM well known to our service who recently underwent a
combined liver/kidney transplant.  His post-operative course was
significant for malnourishment.  He required a dobhoff and tube
feeds to supplement his nutrition.  Once he was medically stable
he was transferred to rehab for further rehabilitation.  Prior
to
discharge there was some concern regarding his rising Alk Phos
levels, but they trended back down and stabilized so it was
decided to send him out with continued follow up.  He now
returns
with findings of eleveated Alk Phos at rehab at 650, AST 30 and
ALT 80.  He was not having any new symptoms or complaints and
states he is doing quite well at rehab.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admission liver duplex demonstrated no specific son[**Name (NI) 493**]
findings to explain abnormal liver function tests. Hepatic
vasculature was patent with normal flow and resistive indices.
There was small-volume ascites. On [**1-22**] a cholangiogram was done
to assess for ductal dilatation and assess the vasculature. Post
procedure, he spiked a temperature to 104. He was transferred to
the SICU for management as he dropped his BP. He was treated
with IV fluids and antibiotics were started (meropenum and vanco
[**1-22**]). Blood cultures grew Klebsiella oxytoca and VRE
(enterococcus facium). Antibiotics were switched to Dapto and
Meropenum after 3 days to Daptomycin and Meropenum. He was
treated for a total of 12 days of dapto ([**Date range (1) 81979**]) and
meropenum ([**Date range (1) 81980**]). Subsequent blood cultures on several days
were negative. A right picc line was inserted ([**1-27**])for IV
antibiotics.

Biopsy findings demonstrated no intrahepatic duct dilation
visualized and no bile leak at the hepaticojejunal anastomosis
site. A biopsy was then performed with features representing
indeterminate to mild acute cellular rejection. This was treated
by increasing his prograf with a target trough level of 15.
Prograf levels increased to 15-16 and as high as 18. Dosage was
adjusted. LFTs were notable for the alk phos dropping to 612
from 963, but then alk phos continued to rise.

On [**1-28**], an MRCP was performed to assess for biliary obstruction
or leak. This demonstrated diffuse mild-to-moderate dilatation
of the entire intrahepatic biliary system. There were several
foci of intrahepatic biliary stenosis as well as a 2-cm segment
of the distal CBD which demonstrated wall thickening and
associated luminal stenosis. Distally, the segment abutted the
anastomosis of CBD and jejunum. Between the diaphragm and the
right lobe of the liver, was a small hematoma. There was a small
amount of free fluid around the hepatic and splenic flexure.

On [**1-29**], he was re-biopsied with findings concerning for biliary
obstruction or ischemia. Prograf was adjusted. On [**2-3**], a
cholangiogram was done showing no obvious dilation of
intrahepatic ducts and possible stricture at lower common bile
duct close to the anastomosis site with the contrast flowing
freely down to the small bowel. An internal-external biliary
draining catheter was placed. After this procedure, LFTs trended
down with alk phos decreasing to 446 from 1155 over
approximately six days on [**2-10**].

He developed severe bilateral upper and lower extremity tremors
and ataxic gait likely from prograf toxicity causing a
significant decline in his ability to ambulate. Neurology was
consulted. This was felt to be related to the prograf, but
thyroid function studies and a MRI of the head were done to
assess his cerebellum. TFTs were significant for a slightly low
T3 otherwise TSH and T4 were normal. The MRI was read by neuro
and neurosurgery who felt that the MRI was unchanged compared to
previous in [**2149-11-8**], prior to starting on immunosuppression.
The two left hemipheric lesions were stable in size,
non-enhancing with contrast, and of unclear etiology. His CSF
profile [**12-8**] was normal, with no evidence of inflammation or
pleiocytosis. He had CSF PCR negative at that time for
HSV/EBV/CMV/[**Male First Name (un) 2326**]/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] there was no need to repeat a spinal
tap. HCV viral load was undetectable. It was not clear what the
lesions  represented, but given no further growth or lack of
enhancement, infection or malignancy were remote possibilities.
A repeat MRI brain WITHOUT CONTRAST (as lesions did not enhance
and given risk of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis/Nephrogenic
Fibrosing Dermopathy)was recommended in 3 months to re-evaluate
for evolution of these lesions. With adjustment of prograf, the
trough levels decreased to 10 and the tremors diminished.
Consequently, his mobility improved.

Nutritionally, he required a feeding tube initially, but
demonstrated sufficient caloric intake to remove the feeding
tube. He was tolerating a regular diet.

Vital signs were stable and he remained afebrile. PT worked with
daily and recommended [**Hospital 41518**] rehab. He was accepted at
[**Hospital1 **].

On the day of discharge, his PTC was removed, but the old
insertion site continued to leak some bile. A urostomy pouch was
placed over this site to collect and record volume of output.
The roux tube that was present since his liver translant surgery
was kept capped. Site was without redness or drainage.

Twice weekly labs should be drawn for cbc, chem 10, LFTs and
trough prograf level with results called to [**Hospital1 18**] Transplant
Office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**].
