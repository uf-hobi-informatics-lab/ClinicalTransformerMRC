Brief Hospital Course:
49 year-old female with history of cervical cancer and many
abdominal surgeries s/p colostomy and [**Hospital 80011**] transferred from
OSH for further management of suspected small bowel obstruction.
Admitted to Medical ICU.
.
# Abdominal pain, nausea ?????? Surgery involved. At this time
diagnosis of SBO suspected, although surgeons are waiting to see
CT abdomen from OSH to solidify diagnosis. Supported by large
number of abdominal surgeries patient has had (-> risk for
adhesions). Also with mildly elevated transaminases and alk
phos. Differential also includes gastroenteritis, cholecystitis,
cholangitis. Mildly febrile and with leukocytosis. Given history
of possibile pneumobilia on CT at OSH hospital, ddx also
includes biliary-enteric anastomosis or fistula. ?history of
hepatitis.
- intially NPO
- NGT to low continuous suction, removed [**9-20**] and started on
sips
- Hydrate with IVF until adequate PO
- Pain control (minimize narcotics)
.
#Pneumothorax: Pt had PTX most likely [**1-3**] line placement at OSH.
 Chest-tube was placed and almost complete resolution of PTX.
-chest tube to suction until [**9-20**] - placed to waterseal
-chest tube removed [**9-21**] without complication
.
# Respiratory failure ?????? Pt previously intubated for hypercarbic
respiratory failure. Likely secondary to narcotics. Pt
successfully extubated and on 4L NC on [**9-18**]
.
# [**Name (NI) 3674**] pt with Hct of 33.9 down from 38.1.  Likely dilutional
from fluids and blood loss from chest tube placment.
.
# Acute renal failure ?????? Creatinine 0.7 today, much improved from
admission. History of vomiting and poor PO intake, this may be
secondary to dehydration. Urine output  >30 cc per hour.
- Continue to hydrate
- Maintain UOP >30cc/hr
.
# UTI - UA with positive nitrite, trace ketones, >50 WBCs, and
many bacteria. Given one dose of ciprofloxacin in ED. Given that
patient has ileostomy, she will likely always have a 'dirty' UA.

- Hold off on treating at this time as may just be a contaminant
- Follow urine culture
.
Patient was successfully extubated in ICU. Continued with
confusion. Restraints applied. Remained NPO with IVF. Mental
status cleared slowly. Transferred to Stone 5 for further
management on [**9-20**].
.

.
[**9-21**] -Abdomen slightly distened. Started on clear liquids.
Tolerating well. No N/V. Right chest tube removed at bedside,
uncomplicated. CXR completed 2 hours after, lungs clear, no
evidence of pneumothorax. Ostomy RN contact[**Name (NI) **] to assist with
management of leaking ostomy and urostomy. Assisted OOB with
nursing. Ambulated without assist. Lives independently with
boyfriend. Diet advanced to regular food in evening. Tolerated
well.
.
[**9-22**] -Continues to tolerate Regular food. Ostomy and Urostomy
putting out adequate amounts of urine/stool. Pain well
controlled with oral medication. Abdominal pain decreased.
