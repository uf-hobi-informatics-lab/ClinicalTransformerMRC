Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4057**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, methemoglobinemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old gentleman well known to the
OMED service, recently discharged for dysphagia, recently s/p
tracheal dilitation and stent placement; presented to the ED
with 2 days of dyspnea, chills and an inability to clear sputum,
leading to difficult sleeping.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.6 110 149/74 20 100. Pulmonary
was consulted and a bronch was performed.  The patient was found
to have a paralyzed R vocal cord.  Around the time of the
bronch, he became hypoxic with sats in the 80s refractory to
oxygenation.  A blood gas was obtained and he was found to have
methemeglobinemia of 64%.  Toxicology was consulted and the
patient was given 90mg of Methylene blue, with subsequent blood
gases demonstrating a reduction in methemeglobin.  The patient
also received Racemic epi & heliox prior to intubation for
stridor. Transfer VS 135 148/95 CMV Peep 10  Fi02100 on
Propofol.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient is intubated and sedated,
unable to provide further history.  His partner confirms the
limited story prior to the ED above.

Imaging:
CT-Neck [**9-3**]: IMPRESSION:

1. Soft tissue attenuation noted within the soft tissues of the
right neck
extending from the level of the hyoid bone inferiorly to the
superior
mediastinum as described above. Nonvisualization of the inferior
right
internal jugular vein, which reconstitutes at the level just
superior to the
hyoid bone. Adjacent focal area of hypoattenuation may represent
thrombosed
jugular vein vs cystic lymph nodes. Color doppler US is may be
obtained for
further characterization.

2. Tracheal stent noted originating in the subglottic airway,
extending to
the superior mediastinum with secretions noted inferior to the
stent.

3. Right vocal cord paralysis, with or without tumor
involvement. Correlation
with direct visualization is recommended.

4. Linear air-filled structure extending to the right of
midline, originating
from the esophagus, possibly representing an esophageal
diverticulum.

5. Lytic lesions in vertebral bodies C2 and C3, present on prior
PET without
abnormal FDG uptake. While these findings may be attributed to
degenerative
change, a bone scan may be obtained for further
characterization.
.
Neck US [**9-3**]: IMPRESSION:

1. Large mass in the right neck consistent with tumor spread.

2. Occlusion of the right internal jugular vein but apparently
related to
mass effect or invasion rather than thrombosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure/Methemeglobinemia:  The patient was
intubated with sats in the high 90s after methylene blue.  ABGs
showed improving trend.  Methemeglobinemia likely over at point
of transfer to MICU.  Weaned off vent to CPAP and was extubated
in the afternoon on [**9-2**] by the pulmonary team.  Cardiac enzymes
were trended and were stable.  Reglan was held. Toxicology
followed during stay in MICU and methylene blue was redosed.
.
# Thyroid & Esphageal Carcinoma: Intent of care remained
palliative during this admission. Chemoradiation was deemed to
not have made a significant impact on the patient's symptoms,
which continue to be cough, difficulty breathing / talking, and
dysphagia. The decision was made to stop further chemotherapy
and pursue potential surgical avenues for further palliation. A
number of medication changes were also made, including starting
Mirtazapine for appetite stimulation per palliative care, and
Acetylcysteine and Codeine/Guiafenesin to promote productive
coughing.
.
# Transient hypotension: The patient developed transient
hypotension in the setting of propofol boluses, diarrhea.
Hypovolemia also possible given sinus tach.  Blood pressure
normalized with fluid boluses and in the absence of fever or
leukocytosis, sepsis was deemed unlikely and empiric Vanc/Zosyn
was discontinued.
.
# ARF: Recent elevation this month in the setting of new chemo,
possibly prerenal from chemo associated diarrhea. Cr remained
stable at 1.2; the patient was discharge with Cr 1.1.
# Hyponatremia: Hypovolemic hyponatremia normalized from 132 to
139 upon discharge with volume resuscitation.

Discharge Disposition:
Home With Service

Facility:
[**Hospital 119**] Homecare

Discharge Diagnosis:
Metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer
Right vocal cord paralysis
Squamous cell cancer of the esophagus
Methemaglobinemia


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker
or cane).


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for issues with your breathing.  A
bronchoscopy was attempted to see if your stent needed
adjustment but it was appropriately positioned.  Due to a rare
side effect of a medication your oxygen level went low and you
had to go to the intensive care unit.  You were then extubated
and brought to the floor.

On the floor we adjusted your medications to try and help you
deal with your coughing and secretions.  This slightly improved.
 Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] discussed mechanical or procedural fixes to your
swallowing and breathing issues with interventional pulmonolgy
and surgery and they have one possible solution that requires
further work up.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will help arrange this next week.


Your medications have been changed.  Please take your
medications as prescribed.
