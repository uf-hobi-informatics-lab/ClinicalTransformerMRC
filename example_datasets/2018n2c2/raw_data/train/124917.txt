Pertinent Results:
[**2190-5-21**] CT Head w/out contrast:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Small frontal subgaleal soft tissue hematoma.
3. Opacification of the right maxillary sinus and nasal cavity
with
intermediate [**Doctor Last Name **] measurements, likely due to chronic sinusitis
and secretions rather than hemorrhage.
4. Bony defect at the medial wall of the right maxillary sinus
is likely
postsurgical after nasal antral window. Linear lucency at the
anterior nasal spine of the maxilla is likely a vascular channel
rather than a fracture given lack of soft tissue swelling.

[**2190-5-21**] CT C-spine w/out contrast:
1. No fracture or acute subluxation.
2. Opacification of the right maxillary sinus and the nasal
cavity, likely due to a combination of chronic sinus disease and
secretions after intubation.

[**2190-5-21**] CT abdomen/pelvis/chest w/ contrast:
1. Large bilateral posterior lung opacities and diffuse
ground-glass
opacities in both lungs, likely due to aspiration given the
clinical history (of an aspiraton event) and the secretions
layering in the distal trachea. 2. No other acute injury of the
chest, abdomen and pelvis.

[**2190-5-22**] TTE:
Mild symmetric LVH with normal global and regional biventricular
systolic function. No clinically-significant valvular disease
seen

[**2190-5-26**] ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) RIGH; FOOT AP,LAT & OBL RIGHT
PORT:
No acute abnormality.

[**2190-5-28**] Chest X-ray (PA & LAT):
PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes
with linear atelectasis at the left lung base. The lungs are
otherwise clear, representing improvement from prior exams. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.

[**2190-5-28**] RUQ Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: Diffuse increased
echotexture of the liver as can be seen with hepatic steatosis.
Advanced conditions of the liver such as cirrhosis or fibrosis
is not excluded. No evidence of cholecystitis or gallstones

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 5239**] was admitted to the Trauma ICU [**2190-5-21**] upon arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**]. He was already intubated. His ICU course was dominated by
respiratory failure and inability to wean from ventilator. It
was felt he had an aspiration event, and that aspiration
pneumonitis was the primary cause of the respiratory failure.
Initially, he required muscular paralysis to maintain ventilator
mechanics, this was weaned off within 48 hours. He continued to
be hypoxic when attempting to wean him from CMV to CPAP, and CXR
showed possible infiltrate, so he was bronched and started on
empiric antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia. He
continued to spike fevers daily until HD 4. When his BAL results
came back as streptococcus pneumoniae, his antibiotics were
briefly narrowed to ceftriaxone monotherapy, then re-broadened
to Vanc/Cipro/Flagyl per the recommendation of an Infectious
Disease consult. To further assist in weaning him from the
ventilator, a lasix drip was begun HD 3 and run for 2 days with
good diuresis. By HD 4, he was transitioned to CPAP and
breathing well on his own mechanics. Also this day, he displayed
groin and back erythema, thought to be a combination of fungal
infection and drug reaction. On HD 5 he was weaned from propofol
and versed to Precedex while simultaneously weaning his PEEP
requirements. He was eventually extubated HD 6 and transferred
to the floor.  Also of note durinig his ICU course: He was
evaluated on CIWA scales but did not score significantly. He had
diarrhea while in the ICU, C.Dif was negative, resolved with
fiber. He was maintained on prophylaxis while in the ICU:
Heparin sub-cu, famotidine, VAP bundle.  He had a left
subclavian central line placed on [**2190-5-21**].

Floor course:
On [**2190-5-26**] he was transferred to the floor. His fever curve was
monitored and trended downward.  His CVL was removed on [**5-26**] and
cultured with no growth. By [**5-27**] he remained afebrile. However,
he was noted to have a rising WBC count to 12 and then 16.9
(from 5.5). His chest xray on [**5-28**] showed no evidence of
pneumonia and he was without cough or sputum. He was weaned off
the oxygen with good oxygen saturation on room air. All
antibiotics were discontinued at this point. Blood test showed
elevated lipase to >800. RUQ US showed hepatic steatosis.
Gastroenterology was consulted and felt this was likely due to
alcoholic pancreatitis. Patient will follow-up in their clinic
for this.

Otherwise he remained hemodynamically stable.
Physical therapy and occupational therapy evaluated him.
Occupational therapy recommended outpatient follow-up with
cognitive neurology.
Patient was discharged and would like to go on voluntary
admission to an alcohol rehab treatment facility.
