History of Present Illness:
78 year old female with history of acute myelofibrosis with
panmyelosis (a rare form of acute leukemia), neutropenic, recent
admission for mild pancreatitis as well as neutropenic fever
after experimental chemotherapy cycle (C1D1 [**2198-4-5**], now C1D26),
now transfered from [**Hospital1 1474**] ED with tongue and anterior neck
swelling. Patient reports having aphthous ulcers in her mouth
for several days secondary to chemotherapy, and had begun using
glycerin (FIRST) mouthwash, after which she noted tongue and
anterior neck swelling this morning. She has used this product
in the past, but not for at least a year. She noticed soon after
using that the bottle was expired. Patient is also on lisinopril
for hypertension, which she has been on long-term. She was
started on allopurinol two weeks ago. Patient noted no chest or
abdominal pain, rashes or pruritus. She did note some dyspnea at

benadryl, famotidine, IV methylprednisolone, and an epinephrine
pen injection, after which symptoms of dyspnea dramatically
improved, per patient report. She was then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management. Her tongue was still noted to be swollen
on arrival, though she has not had any throat tightness or
stridor symptoms.

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Acute myelofibrosis with panmyelosis:
- [**12/2195**]: presented with pancytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy at OSH

showed >40% blasts. Subsequent bone marrow biopsy done at [**Hospital1 18**]

showed acute myelofibrosis with panmyelosis, a rare form of
acute leukemia, versus acute megakaryoblastic leukemia with
acute myelofibrosis. The patholgy report favors the former given

CD34 positive expression on blast cells.

- [**2197-6-19**]: repeat bone marrow biopsy showed ~50% cellularity
(previously 20%), 5% blasts by CD4 staining, grade [**1-26**] fibrosis

(fibrosis essentially unchanged from previous), with
normal-appearing megakaryocytes. Her chemo cycle duration was
increased from every 28 days to 42 days.
- [**10-1**]: acute cholecystitis sp ERCP with cocnurrent klebsiella

bacteremia, had lap chole on [**11-1**].
- [**2197-12-30**]: restarted decitabine after prolonged discontinuation
secondary to cholecystectomy (completed 9 total cycles)
- [**3-19**]: admitted for febrile neutropenia with no source
identified.
- [**2198-4-5**] RAD001 5 mg po

Brief Hospital Course:
78F with history of acute myelofibrosis with panmyelosis (a rare
form of acute leukemia), neutropenic, recent admission for mild
pancreatitis as well as neutropenic fever after experimental
chemotherapy cycle(C1D8 of Protocol 08-269 A Phase I (RAD001
PKC412, day 1=[**2198-4-5**], last dose [**2198-4-12**]), now presenting with
tongue and anterior neck swelling likely [**1-24**] lisinopril allergy

#. Tongue/neck swelling/Allergy to ACEI: Most likely allergic
reaction to ACEI (was on lisinopril).  Less likely etiologies
would be her study drug for myelofibrosis.  Patient received IV
steroids, benadryl and famotidine with improvement in symptoms,
and was switched to a PO regimen of prednisone 60 mg for a total
of 3 days..  Did not have stridor nor require intubation.
Allergy was consulted and felt that swelling likely [**1-24**] ACEI so
lisinopril was dc'ed and she is not to take ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **] in the
future.  It was also recommended that she receive her study drug
under observation such as in the infusion clnic to monitor for
possible reaction.  Tryptase was sent to evaluate for C1
esterase inhibitor deficiency and is still pending.

#. Hypertension: Given likely allergy to lisinopril, it was
stopped.  Home metoprolol was continued at 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] and
amlodipine 5mg daily started to help better control BP, as she
had SBP 150-160s.

#. Myelofibrosis with panmyelosis: on C1D26 or experimental
chemotherapy regimen. Recommenedation that pt should receive
experimental medications while observed as above. Continued
prophylactic levofloxacin and valacyclovir as well as home dose
allopurinol. Transfused 1 unit platelets and 1 unit of PRBC
during admission

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 9449**],
You were admitted to the intensive care unit with swelling of
your tongue and neck.  It is possible that this was from your
study medication or it may have been due to the blood pressure
medication Lisinopril that you had been taking.  You should no
longer take lisinopril just in case the swelling was from this
medication.  Your symptoms improved with medications and
steroids.

The following medications were changed this admission:
1. STOP LISINOPRIL - you should never take this medication
again.  You should not take medications in this class (ace
inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers).
2. Please START Prednisone 60mg daily for 1 more day.
3. Please START amlodipine 5mg daily for your blood pressure.
4. Please START benadryl as needed if you develop throat
tightness, lip swelling.

Please keep your followup appointments with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and your
primary care physician.
