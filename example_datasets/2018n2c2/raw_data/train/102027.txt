IMPRESSION:
Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions. Marked interval
improvement in right-sided pleural effusion. Support lines as
described. No pneumothorax. Increased airspace opacity involving
both lungs may simply reflect low lung volumes, but mild
pulmonary edema is not excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 68 F with ESRD on HD, CHF, Afib on
coumadin; admit to MICU with supratherapeutic INR now s/p 4
units FFP and IV vit K.
.
# Elevated INR. The patient had an elevated INR which was
greater than assay at one point early on in her admission. Of
note, the patient took a bowel regimen for constipation and
reports significant diarrhea prior to admission.  The patient
was not taking excess coumadin doses.  In addition the patient
was on vancomycin for a previous HD catheter infection which
could have contributed to the increased INR.  The patient had no
signs of bleeding at the time of admission or during her
hospitalization.  Her INR normalized with giving IV vit K and 4
units of FFP.  The patient was restarted on coumadin prior to
discharge.  She was discharged on 4mg of coumadin daily with a
follow up INR check at hemodialysis.
.
# Hypotension. The patient became hypotensive with SBPs in the
70s in ED and at HD.  She was admitted to the MICU for
monitoring and her home BP medications were stopped.  She had a
negative blood cx and a negative CXR.  She was receiving
vancomycin with HD for a previous line infection.  Her SBP on
the day of discharge ranged from 100-110s and she was not
restarted on her BP meds prior to discharge.
.
#Hypothyroidism: She had and elevated TSH at 5.2 and a normal
free T4.  Her dose of levothyroxine was increased from 125 to
150mcg daily.
.
# Systolic CHF: The patient has systolic CHF with an EF of 15%.
She received 4 units FFP plus additional IVF while in the MICU.
She did not require early HD as she was not volume overloaded.
Her carvedilol and ACEI were held due to her hypotension and not
restarted prior to discharge.
.
# Diabetes type II: The patient was continued on her home Lantus
and ISS.
.
# ESRD on HD: The patient received HD while at the hospital as
per her normal schedule.  She finished her doses of vancomycin
for her previous line infection.
.
# CAD. The patient has a history of CAD and CABG x2 with CHF.
She was continued on ASA while in the hospital.  The patient was
not able to tell me the name of her new PCP so [**Name Initial (PRE) **] could not find
out why she was no longer on a statin.  I did confirm her
medications with her pharmacy and she was not receiving a
statin.  Her ACE and beta-blocker were held due to her
hypotension.  These medications should be restarted as an
out-patient after follow up with her PCP.
.
#Lesions on back of calf and bleeding of R big toe secondary to
nail clipping.  The lesion of the back of her calf is surrounded
by erythematous tissue suggesting adequate blood flow to heal
the lesion.
.
Left phantom limb pain.  The patient felt her ultram was not
helping her.  She uses a lidocaine patch on her left leg which
provides some relief.  I started gabapentin which the patient
requested to be discharged on.
.
# Full code: discussed with patient
