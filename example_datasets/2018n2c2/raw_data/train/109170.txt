ETT [**2153-4-6**]:
Ms [**Known lastname 24850**] is a 55 year old woman with history of
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension who presents with typical
angina
for several months. She completed 4 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**]
protocol
representing a poor exercise tolerance for her age; ~ 2.8 METs.
The
test was stopped due to fatigue. She complained of substernal
chest
pain ([**7-5**]) 2 minutes into exercise that peaked at 7/10 which
resolved 5
minutes into recovery. There were 0.[**Street Address(2) 20505**] depression at
peak
exercise which resolved upon rest. During recovery she had T
wave
inversions starting from 2 minutes in recovery to 7 minutes in
recovery.
She had a run of atrial tachycardia 2 minutes into recovery
lasting for
6 beats. The rhythm was sinus. The patient was hypertensive at
baseline
however had appropriate hemodynamic response to exercise.
IMPRESSION: Anginal symptoms at low workload with ST changes
suggestive
of myocardial ischemia. Nuclear report sent separately.
.
Nuclear stress [**4-6**]:
Probably normal myocardial perfusion at level of exercise
achieved with mild fixed apicoanterior and apical defect which
is commonly seen with our current camera. However, given the
stress results an LAD distribution lesion can not be excluded.
.
Cath [**4-9**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated
single vessel CAD. The LMCA had no angiographically apparent
CAD. The
LAD had a 50% stenosis in the mid vessel. The LCx had no
angiographically apparent CAD. The RCA had a proximal 50%
stenosis and a
distal 70% stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension with an SBP of 154 mmHg.
3. Successful PTCA and placement of a 2.5x12mm Promus drug
eluting stent
in the mid RCA and a 2.5x12mm Promus drug eluting stent in the
proximal
RCA.  Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent
dissection, and
no residual stenoses.  (See PTCA comments.)
4. The right common femoral arteriotomy was successfully closed
using a
6 Fr Angioseal VIP device.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel CAD.
2. Successful placement of DES to RCA.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 55-year-old woman with a past medical history of DM
II, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and a strong family history of CAD who
was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after an ETT suggestive of myocardial
ischemia.  Patient underwent cardiac catherization on [**4-9**] and
had 2 DES placed to RCA.

CAD:  Patient has multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN,
hyperlipidemia, DM II, and a strong family history of heart
disease.  An ETT on [**4-6**] was suggestive of myocardial ischemia.
Patient underwent cardiac catherization (via right groin) on
[**4-9**] without complications.  Two DES were placed to RCA.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 24850**] was maintained on home lisinopril 10mg qd and started
on Plavix, Toprol 25mg qd, Simvastatin 40mg qd, and ASA 325mg
qd.  She was maintained on telemetry and monitored with serial
EKGs.  Last HgbA1C is 7.9--patient is on 3 oral hypoglycemics as
an outpatient, but may be switched to insulin by primary
provider.  (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] been notified of
patient admission and elevated HgbA1C).  Patient will follow-up
with Dr.[**Name (NI) 3733**] in cardiology clinic on [**4-17**].
.
ASPIRIN DESENSITIZATION:  Patient with known allergy to aspirin
including shortness of breath, chest pain, and diaphoresis.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 24850**] was successfully desensitized to aspirin in CCU on
[**4-8**] via ASA desensitization protocol.  She should continue
taking aspirin daily; if she fails to do so, her allergy may
return.
.
DIABETES:  Patient with DM II for the last ~20 years not ideally
controlled on 3 oral agents.  (Last HgbA1C is 7.9).  During this
admission she was started on glargine and an insulin sliding
scale.  Ms. [**Known lastname 24850**] will be discharged on her home
hypoglycemics, but her PCP may decide to switch to insulin for
superior control.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is in agreement with this plan.
.
HYPERLIPIDEMIA:  Patient was discharged on Simvastatin 40mg QD.
.
HYPERTENSION:  Patient was maintained on home ACE-I and started
on Toprol 25mgQD.
.
ANXIETY:  Patient with baseline anxiety, exacerbated by hospital
stay.  Patient was seen by social work consult, and may benefit
from counseling as an outpatient.
.
CHRONIC BACK PAIN, NEUROPATHY:  Nortryptaline was continued.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 24850**],
It was a pleasure taking care of you on this admission.  You
were admitted to the hospital because of an exercise tolerance
test (stress test), which showed some damaged heart muscle.  You
had a cardiac catherization on [**4-9**] and 2 DES (drug eluding
stents) were placed into your right coronary artery.  IT IS VERY
IMPORTANT THAT YOU TAKE A MEDICATION CALLED PLAVIX (CLOPIDOGREL)
UNTIL INSTRUCTED OTHERWISE BY YOUR DOCTOR.
.
You also underwent a procedure during which we "desensitized"
you to aspirin.  You can now take aspirin without having an
allergy to this medication.  It is very important that you take
aspirin every day or else your allergy may return.
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
1.  START Plavix (Clopidogrel) 75mg once a day
2.  START Aspirin 325mg once a day
3.  START Toprol XL 25mg once a day
4.  STOP taking omeprazole
5.  START Ranitidine 150mg once a day
.
Please take all of your medications as prescribed.  Please keep
all of your follow-up appointments.
.
Return to the hospital if you develop chest pain, shortness of
breath, severe headache, palpitations, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, bleeding in your urine or stools, fevers, chills, or
other concerning signs or symptoms.
