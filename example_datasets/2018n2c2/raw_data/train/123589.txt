History of Present Illness:
Hepatologist:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**]
PCP:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 92101**] is a 59yo woman with h/o Hepatitic C Cirrhosis with
portal hypertension s/p TIPS, MELD score 23, who presented to an
OSH with altered mental status.
.
Her father found her on the morning of admission with her legs
hanging over the side of the bed.  She was unresponsive.  The
family reports that she had been feeling well at home but
becoming increasingly confused.  They admit that she often
fights against taking lactulose, though they feel she is largely
compliant with it.  She may have spit out her lactulose dose
last night.  Otherwise, ROS significant for some nausea.  She
has nevertheless been eating and drinking well.  No diarrhea.
No fevers.
.
When EMS arrived, her blood sugar was 146.  She was noted to be
incontinent of urine.
.
Upon arrival to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital3 6783**], her VS were 129/60   117   21
98% RA.  She was intubated because of failure to protect her
airway.  Although the lowest recorded temp was 96.2 rectally,
she was noted as being hypothermic and a bair hugger was placed.
 Labs were notable for K of 6.2 and non-gap acidosis with HCO3
of 14.  Lactate was elevated at 5.6.  WBC elevated at 16 with
Hct and Cr at baseline.  UA significant for large leukocytes and
negative nitrites.  CT Head without contrast revealed vague area
of low attenuation in the lft frontal region, ? related to small
vessel ischemia.  There was no evidence of bleed, mass, or
midline shift.  CXR revealed vascular congestion.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, she was intubated.  Further history
was obtained via phone call through the patient's son.
.
ROS:  unable to obtain

[**2185-11-16**] CT Head without constrast:  No acute intracranial
process
.
[**2185-11-16**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] and Brain without contrast:  Limited study due
to motion artifact. No contrast was administered due to the
patient's inability to further cooperate and the marginal renal
status. There is no evidence of infarction. The MRA demonstrates
a dominant and patent right vertebral artery with a tiny, but
apparently patent left vertebral artery, and patent internal
carotid arteries bilaterally. The remainder of the study,
although limited, demonstrates no evidence of hemorrhage or
other abnormalities.
.
[**2185-11-17**] CT abd and pelvis w/o contrast: 1. No evidence of
hemoperitoneum or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
2. Cirrhotic liver, with signs for portal hypertension with a
large amount of ascites.
3. Consolidation within the lower lobes of the lungs
bilaterally, most likely represents atelectasis. However,
superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
4. Cholelithiasis.
5. Anasarca.
.
[**2185-11-22**] Liver, gallbladder u/s: 1. Patent TIPS with abnormally
high velocities within the mid and distal aspects of the shunt,
similar to the previous exam. Findings remain compatible with
TIPS malfunction.
2. Limited evaluation of the left and anterior right portal vein
although
suggestion of abnormal directionality of flow within the left
portal vein
is compatible with shunt dysfunction.
3. Cirrhotic liver with moderate-to-severe perihepatic ascites
and
cholelithiasis.
.
[**2185-11-24**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass is seen
on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2185-10-27**], no major change is evident.
.
IMPRESSION: no obvious vegetations seen


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92101**] is a 59yo woman who presented w/ altered mental
status in the setting of Hep C cirrhosis.

# Altered Mental Status: Given her hx of hep C cirrhosis and
recent TIPs procedure, her AMS was thought to be most likely due
to hepatic encephalopathyy. She was reported to have a hx of
poor compliance with lactulose at home.  Of note, she has not
had other episodes of hepatic encephalopathy prior to this.
Head CT at OSH was negative.  Given her leukocytosis on
admission, infection, particularly SBP or pneumonia, were also
considered. Overdose was also a possibility, although family
denies drug use. Upon arrival in the MICU she was started on
lactulose and rifaximine. She underwent a paracentesis to eval
for SBP, which had a negative gram stain and culture. Given her
AMS, she was considered high risk for aspiration, and she was
started on empiric treatment with vanc/aztreonam/azithromycin
(allergic to cipro and keflex) for nosocomial or aspiration PNA
vs SBP. While there was no known hx of EtOH abuse, thiamine IV
was administered. On exam the pt had some focal findings of
persistent right-[**Hospital1 **] and downward deviation of her eyes, with
inability to track past midline. She had a repeat head CT and an
MRI/MRA which were both without evidence of significant
pathology. Following extubation and decreased sedation, her
mental status improved and the focal eye findings resolved.
While not back at her baseline, pt was awake, alert, and
oriented x3 when she was transferred to the floor. Pt seen by
Neurology, but had already had significant improvement and no
focal findings. On the floor, her mental status continued to
improve. At time of discharge, she is back to baseline,
conversational, oriented x3 but at times is tearful. She is
being discharged on Rifaximin and furosemide.
.
# Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated for airway
protection at OSH.  Her CXR here suggested a possible aspiration
pneumonia, which could have been [**3-12**] to her AMS.  It is unclear
if she received IVF at OSH. She was weaned off of the vent
quickly as she required minimal pressure support and had good
RSBIs. She was extubated on [**2185-11-17**] was satting well on room air
at the time of transfer to the floor. On discharge, she
continues to have oxygen saturations in the high 90's on room
air.
.
# Rash: Pt arrived in the MICU with three skin findings. Bullae,
blisters/breakdown, and a  diffuse maculopapular rash on
proximal legs and trunk. Dermatology was consulted. The blisters
and bullae were thought to be [**3-12**] trauma in the setting of
coagulopathy due to liver disease and thinned skin. Urine
Porphobilinogens were checked to rule out porphyria in the
setting of Hep C liver disease and were negative. The diffuse
maculopapular rash appeared to be new, and looks more like a
hypersensitivity reaction, likely to ertapenem. Pt has known
allergies to Keflex ad Cipro, and had received ertapenem at the
OSH. She was treated with topical clobetasol cream to the rash
on abdomen and lower extremities (avoiding folds), and
hydrocortisone 2.5% cream to rash in folds of abdomen and groin.
Also, the bullae over time evolved into ulcerations on the pt's
legs, arms and left shoulder which were treated with wound care
as recommended by our wound care team and plastics.
.
# Cirrhosis [**3-12**] Hep C: Pt was treated as described above with
lactulose and rifaximine as well as a PPI, and was followed by
Hepatology.  She had a RUQ ultrasound on [**11-16**] and again on [**11-23**]
which showed her TIPS was patent. She should have a repeats TIPS
ultrasound in 1 month. She had a 5L paracentesis on [**11-20**] which
was negative for increased WBC and culture was sterile.
.
# VRE: Pt had blood culture [**11-16**] which grew VRE sensitive to
daptomycin and linezolid in [**2-11**] bottles. Daptomycin was started
on [**11-17**].  ID was consulted in house. TTE showed no vegetations
on [**11-24**].  The pt should be continued on IV daptomycin to
complete a 14 day course on [**2185-12-2**].
.
# Sinus tachycardia: Pt was likely intravascularly dry on
admission given Hct above baseline, poor urine output, and
tachycardia above baseline, although some level of tachyardia
appears to be chronic in her.  Also may be exacerbated by acute
illness. She received albumin 25g in 500cc NS x2 and her HR and
urine output were followed. Her diuretics were held until the
next morning. At discharge, her HR remains in the 80's to 90's.
.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure: Appeared hypovolemic
admission, her diuretics were held as above. Her diuretics were
gradually restarted on the floor. She is not accumulating
ascited at the time of discharge.
.
# Chronic Kidney Disease:  baseline Cr 1.8-2.0, Cr on discharge
1.5, urine output initially poor on admission, but improved
after fluid challenge.
.
# Thyroid nodule: Should be followed up as outpatient.
.
# Hyponatremia: Pt has chronic hyponatremia seen on past
admission with baseline 128-130. As diuretics were increased,
her sodium gradually decreased to 129 on day of discharge.
Treatment ongoing for this condition should include ongoing
fluid restriction to approximately 1500cc/day.
.
# Hypercalcemia: Pt had transient hypercalcemia to 10.8 this
admission thought to be [**3-12**] Calcium and vitamin D use at home.
These were stopped and Ca is now 9.9 at time of discharge.
Recommend not restarting these medications at this time.
.
# [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt with thrombocytopenia this admission
thought [**3-12**] chronic liver disease. Plt at discharge are 164.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus Bacteremia
Encephalopathy
Traumatic Skin Rash
Hyponatremia

Secondary:
Hepatitis C Cirrhosis
Chronic Kidney Disease


Discharge Condition:
Afebrile, stable, ambulatory.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after you were found passed out at home. This
was likely due to encephalopathy which cleared with lactulose,
and an infection that was found in your blood. You will continue
on an antibiotic, Daptomycin, intravenously for a total of 14
days, finishing on [**12-2**]. Please be sure to renally dose
this medication: once daily if GFR>50 or once every other day if
GFR<50.
.
Continuing issues include hyponatremia, which should be managed
initially with fluid restriction. She has had chronic
hyponatremia with baseline 128-130 on previous admission here.
Please monitor sodium levels while at [**Hospital1 **].
.
Her course has also been complicated by easy bruising and
blistering which has necessitated a dermatology consult. It was
felt these were traumatically induced. They are being cared for
currently with wound care.
.
Of note, the patient was hypercalcemic, and found to have
elevated PTH level. She had been taking ergocalciferol and
cholecalciferol both of which were stopped, and the calcium
normalized. Please continue to hold these medications, to be
restarted at the discretion of her primary care physician and
[**Hospital1 **] physician.
