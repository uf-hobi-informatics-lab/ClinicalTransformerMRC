History of Present Illness: 75 year old woman on Coumadin and
Plavix, s/p mechanical MVR, h/o GI bleed (ten years ago), now
presenting with black tarry stools overnight, with 2 additional
episodes of melena this morning. Pt was seen in urgent care at
PCP's office today and was guaiac positive. In PCP office she
noted three black tarry stools. During this time, she has no
nausea, vomiting, no epigastric pain, no lightheadedness, and no

grounds. Following NGT placement the pt developed brisk
epistaxis, now has packing in place. Repeat hct stable at 40.
Major source of bleeding is now iatrogenic nosebleed. Vitals on
transfer were: 96.4 HR 97 127/63 19 100%RA.

Pertinent Results:
EGD [**2188-10-22**]: Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Mild erosion in the antrum compatible with gastritis
Erythema in the stomach body compatible with NG tube-induced
trauma
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
During this procedure, we did not find activate bleeding.
Small hiatal hernia
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Because we did not identify the etiology of her
G.I. bleeding during this procedure, she might need colonoscopy
to rule out right colonic bleeding. We will discuss with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2987**] this afternoon to recommend either regular colonoscopy or
virtual colonoscopy.

Colonoscopy [**2188-10-23**]: Angioectasia in the cecum (thermal
therapy)
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
Recommendations: In patient care
Capsule endoscopy. Serial hematocrits

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 75 year old woman on Coumadin and Plavix,
s/p mechanical MVR, h/o GI bleed (ten years ago), now presenting
with GI bleeding in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR, c/b
nasal bleeding following NGT placement.
.
# GI Bleed: The pt had three melenotic stools over 24 hrs, but
has stable hct on labs and is otherwise asymptomatic (without
fatigue, shortness of breath with exertion, chest pain, or
orthostasis). NG lavage was negative for any coffee ground
material or bloody contents. EGD did not reveal any source of
bleed. The patient also underwent colonoscopy, revealing a
bleeding AVM, which was coagulated using thermal therapy. She
will need a capsule endoscopy as an out-patient in order to
assess for additional, non-visualized AVM in the small bowel.
She was monitored with serial hematocrits, which trended
downward precipitating transfusion with 1 unit of blood. Her
anti-coagulation with Plavix and Coumadin was held for her
procedures. After, she was re-started on coumadin with a heparin
bridge to therapeutic INR, and her plavix was restarted after
being held for 7 days.  Her hematocrit was stable at discharge.
She was discharged once INR was therapeutic.
.
# Nasal trauma: Following NGT placement, pt developed bleeding
from nose that was quite profuse. Packing was placed by ENT
which was dislodged overnight. We suspect that a minor
lac/contusion from NG tube in the setting of elevated INR
precipitated this event. She experienced no further epistaxis
during this admission.
.
# Mechanical MV replacement: Goal INR is 2.5-3.5. The patient is
on a higher dose of Coumadin (5.5mg) to maintain this INR. Per
discussion with cardiology, her anti-coagulation was not
reversed. All anticoagulation was held pending her EGD, and she
was started on a heparin drip afterwards. After her colonoscopy,
she was restarted on Coumadin and a heparin drip was used to
bridge the patient until her INR was therapeutic. At discharge,
her INR was 2.6.
.
# CAD s/p 1 vessel CABG [**2177**]: The patient's beta blocker was
initially held so as not to mask hypovolemia. It was re-started
after the patient's procedures with normal heart rate and
excellent blood pressure control.
.
# TIA's (on plavix): Plavix was restarted after being held for a
total of 7 days after her colonoscopy.

Discharge Condition:
Stable, BP --, HR --, no recurrence of GI bleeding after
colonoscopy with thermal therapy, HCT stable at --.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for GI bleeding. You had an
EGD, which showed gastritis in your stomach.  You also had a
colonoscopy, which showed an AVM (arteriovenous malformation) in
the cecum which was coagulated with thermal therapy to stop the
bleeding. It also showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.
You will need to get a capsule endoscopy as an outpatient. This
will be coordinated by gastroenterology.

* We restarted your Coumadin before discharge. Your INR was
between 2.5 and 3.5 at discharge. You will need to have a follow
up INR check with your regular doctor next week. You should take
your Coumadin as per your prior regimen (5.5mg every day but
Saturday, on Saturday take 4mg).
