SBP of 100 down from 140 in the ED, but repeat was 120/80, and
she remained hemodynamically stable.  However, Hct trended down
from 31 to 25, and she was transferred to the ICU for closer
monitoring and EGD.  She recieved 2 units PRBCs, with Hct bump
to 28.9.  EGD was remarkable for a single cratered 15mm ulcer
with oozing from the edges just distal to the gastrojejunal
anastomosis, which was injected with epinephrine and cauterized
successfully for hemostasis.  Post-procedure, she was
hemodynamically stable, her Hct was 30.3, and she was
transferred back to the floor.  Once back on the floor, she did
very well, and remained hemodynamically stable.  She had no
abdominal pain, nausesa or vomiting.  Her Hct at discharge was
stable at 32.2, and her diet was advanced to regular.  She had
not yet had a bowel movement post-procedure, but was passing
