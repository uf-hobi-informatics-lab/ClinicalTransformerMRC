[**2158-5-3**] ECHO
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen when BP>150, mild when BP @ 11O

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26644**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2158-4-27**] for
surgical management of his coronary artery disease. He was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid
duplex ultrasound which showed less then a 40% stenosis
bilaterally. Plavix was allowed to washout of his system. On
[**2158-5-3**], Mr. [**Known lastname 26644**] was taken to the operating room where
he underwent off pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Please
see operative note for details.
In summary he had:
1. Urgent off-pump coronary artery bypass graft x4, left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and
saphenous vein grafts to diagonal, obtuse    marginal and
posterior descending arteries.
2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. He woke neurologically intact and was extubated.
Amiodarone was started for rapid atrial fibrillation. He
required close monitoring of his pulmonary status. After
aggressive diuresis and weaning from pressor support he was
transferred on postoperative day four to the step down unit for
further recovery. The remainder of his hospital stay was
uneventful, he worked with physical therapy and nursing to
increase his  strength and mobility. On POD5 he was discharged
home with visiting nurses and home physical therapy.
