Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 25006**] is a 72 year old female with a history of stage
IIIA carcinosarcoma of the uterus, stage I mucinous carcinoma of
the ovary, rheumatoid arthritis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
with aortic stenosis who presents with hypotension.  The patient
states that she has had SBP in the upper 80s to 90s for the past
month.  Yesterday, her VNA noted that she was hypotensive into
the 80s and the patient felt lightheaded.  She went to the
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  At the OSH ED she had erythema noted around her
ankles bilaterally and low grade temps, but no leukocytosis.
She was found to be in acute renal failure with a creatinine of
2.2.  In the ED she received IVFs at 1/2 NS at 100 cc/hr with
blood pressures improving to the 90s (which is her baseline);
she was mentating well.  She was empirically covered with Zosyn.
 Her CXR was clear, however she was mildly hypoxemic after
receiving IVF for her hypotension.  Normally, she does not have
an oxygen requirement and is 96 - 97% on room air, however she
was noted to be 88-89%, with ABG showing: 7.39/39/57/24 on room
air.  V/Q scan and LENIs were obtained given hypoxia and were
negative. Zosyn was stopped and she was started on cefepime and
vancomycin. Serial troponins were also negative.  BNP 371.  This
evening she was receiving 1/2NS at 100 cc/hr prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to the ICU the patient was comfortable and denied any
shortness of breath.  She has had increasing bilateral lower
extremity edema for the past two months.  She believes the
redness in her legs came on suddenly yesterday, but does recall
having similar redness in her legs toward the end of her
chemotherapy several years ago.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI, + chills after chemo for a few hours, resolved.
(-) Denies fever. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea
or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest
pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in
bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or
myalgias.

.
[**4-13**] CXR:
Severe cardiac enlargement has increased, consistent with
progressive
cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. The most significant
change has
been the great increase in size of multiple large pulmonary
nodules. There is no good evidence for pneumonia and none for
pulmonary edema, nor is pleural effusion substantial.
.
[**4-14**] Echo:
IMPRESSION: Small, hypertrophied, hyperdynamic left ventricle.
There is a severe resting LVOT gradient. The aortic valve is
severely thickened with significant stenosis (unable to estimate
valve are due to difficulty in measuring LVOT diameter and
presence of LVOT obstruction). Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. Small, circumferential effusion without evidence
of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-2-3**],
the findings are similar.
.
[**4-14**] ECG:
Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats and ST-T wave
abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of [**2121-2-17**] the rate is faster and the
QRS voltage in lead aVL is less prominent with a more vertical
axis. ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent. Clinical
correlation is suggested.
.
[**4-16**] CTA:
1. Interval progression with larger pulmonary metastases,
adenopathy and new hepatic metastasis.
2. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Mild pulmonary artery dilation with moderate pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 25006**] is a 72 year old female with stage IIIA
carcinosarcoma of the uterus and a stage I mucinous carcinoma of
the ovary undergoing carboplatin chemotherapy who presents with
hypotension.

# Hypotension - Etiology remained unclear. Differential
diagnosis included sepsis (perhaps [**3-18**] cellulitis of LE's, but
without other obvious infectious source), hypovolemia (but
appeared volume overloaded on exam), CHF with 3rd spacing of
volume but intravascular volume depletion, versus medication
(chemotherapy) side effect.  Differential also included
pericardial effusion and tamponade - ruled out by TTE. With
treatment of CHF (diuresis with one-time doses of lasix) and of
cellulitis (with antibiotics), saw patient's BP improve.
Antihypertensives held during hospitalization and on discharge.
Appears patient's baseline SBP is in the 90s. Patient ambulated
without lightheadedness.
.
# Hypoxia - Developed in OSH ED after she received IVF for her
hypotension; in the setting of AS and hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, likely became volume overloaded. Was voume
overloaded on exam, with crackles, peripheral edema, weight
elevation, BNP elevation. Other possibilites include worsening
of HOCM, or worsened diffuse pulmonary metastasis as seen on CT
in [**2121-2-14**] which may have further reduced pulmonary
reserve. With diuresis, patient's oxygen requirement resolved,
albeit slowly. CTA was done to rule out PE - negative for PE.
Patient ambulated without SOB and without desaturation. In fact,
SpO2 improved with ambulation, so perhaps there was an
atelectatic component (heard as crackles at the bases perhaps)
that improved with opening up of airways upon ambulation.
.
# Cellulitis - Bilateral erythema and warmth of lower legs on
exam.  Could be cellulitis vs. hyperemia from edema vs. reaction
to chemotherapy medications (patient reports redness in legs
previously when on this chemotherapy regimen). Patient treated
with vancomycin and then keflex. Patient diuresed with lasix
one-time doses.
.
# Acute renal failure - Baseline creatinine around 1 and 1.0 on
[**4-10**].  Was 2.2 at OSH and became 1.3 after getting IV hydration.
Seemed pre-renal etiology given improvement in creatinine w/ IV
fluids; then patient was diuresed for CHF/volume overload
concern, and Cr continued to improve down to 0.8.
.
# Tachycardic runs - appear to be SVT (narrow complex, regular,
no P waves, came on/off suddenly), seen intermittently and
asymptomatic. Ruled out PE with CTA.
.
# Normocytic Anemia - Was 32.8 at OSH; after receiving fluids
HCT has fallen further to 30. Baseline is 35 - 40. Not
clinically bleeding. Perhaps due to chemotherapy.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - 137 down from 700 earlier. Likely  related
to marrow suppression from chemotherapy.
.
# Asthma history? - continued home regimen of singulair,
fluticasone prn, and formulary exchange maxair with albuterol.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia - patient no longer taking fenofibrate
d/t concern for possible side effects.  Takes fluvastatin every
other day - formulary exchanged with pravastatin.
.
# Uterine & Ovarian cancer - plan for next chemotherapy on
Thursday [**4-24**], as an inpatient, due to concerns for side
effects and desire for o/n monitoring.

[**Hospital3 **] VNA

Discharge Diagnosis:
Hypoxia
Volume (fluid) overload
Carcinosarcoma of the uterus
Mucinous carcinoma of the ovary
Cellulitis
Hypotension


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with low oxygen, low blood
pressure, and leg redness/swelling. We believe that your
symptoms were due to fluid overload, so you were diuresed with
lasix and your breathing (oxygen level) improved. We ruled out a
clot in the lungs, and did an echocardiogram to show that your
heart function was similar to previously. We are treating you
for a skin infection of the legs, with antibiotics, and your
legs are improving in terms of their redness, pain, and
swelling. It is unclear why your blood pressure was low, but
with diuresis (fluid removal) and treatment of infection, your
blood pressure improved up to baseline.
.
You spent time in the ICU, and then on the regular oncology
floor.
.
On discharge, you were walking well without a need for oxygen,
your blood pressure had improved/elevated, and your leg symptoms
were improving.
.
The following changes were made to your medication regimen:
- take Keflex (cephalexin), an antibiotic, twice a day until the
evening of [**4-19**]
- do NOT take your Hyzaar (HCTZ/Losartan) or Verapamil, until
next week when you see your cardiologist or come to the hospital
for chemotherapy (we are holding these medications temporarily
because of your borderline-low blood pressure)
.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop
chest pain, shortness of breath, weight gain greater than 2
pounds, palpitations, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain,
worsening leg swelling/redness/pain, lightheadedness.

Followup Instructions:
Please come to [**Hospital1 18**] and go to the [**Location (un) 436**] of the [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**]
building on Thursday [**4-24**], at approximately 9 AM. Please
present to the Oncology front desk. You will then have
chemotherapy that day, and spend that night overnight in the
hospital.
.
Please remember to see your cardiologist, at the following
previously-scheduled appointment:
