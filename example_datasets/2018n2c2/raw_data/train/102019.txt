CXR [**6-13**]
Moderate right pleural effusion with right lung base
consolidation. Smaller opacification likely pneumonia at the
left upper lobe.  Repeat imaging to document resolution after
treatment.
.
U/S [**6-14**]
Satisfactory morphologic appearance of both kidneys with no
evidence of
hydronephrosis, renal mass or shadowing calculi.
The bladder is empty containing an indwelling Foley catheter.
.
ECHO [**2134-6-16**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a very small,
predominantly anterior pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No
IMPRESSION: Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic
function. No significant valvular disease. No valvular
vegetations identified.
.
KUB [**2134-6-16**]
IMPRESSION:  Paucity of abdominal gas without evidence of toxic
megacolon.
.
U/S [**6-19**]
1.  Distended gallbladder containing layering sludge without
definite stones.  No gallbladder wall edema.  Though no specific
signs of cholecystitis are present, acute acalculous
cholecystitis cannot be excluded.
2.  Uniform dilation of the extrahepatic common duct, up to 1.0
cm, to the
level of the pancreatic head, below which the duct is not seen
well.  MRCP may be helpful for further evaluation if there is
clinical concern. If not
obtained LFTs should be followed.
3.  Small amount of ascites.
.
DOPPLER U/S
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.  Cephalic vein
(superficial) thrombosis at the level of the antercubital fossa.

.
CXR [**7-1**]
There is a new tracheostomy tube in standard position.  Right IJ
catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Mild vascular
congestion is increased.  Bibasilar opacities are unchanged.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are also stable.  There is no
evident pneumothorax.  The opacities in the lower lobes may
reflect atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be
totally excluded.
.
MRI [**2134-6-30**]
FINDINGS:  Diffusion images demonstrate multiple small areas of
restricted
diffusion in both cerebral hemispheres, predominantly in the
subcortical white matter in the periventricular region including
involvement of the left side of the corpus callosum suggestive
of acute infarcts.  There are no acute infarcts seen in the
brainstem or cerebellum.  Mild brain atrophy is seen.  Mild
changes of small vessel disease identified.  Small amount of
fluid is seen in the left sphenoid sinus and bilateral mastoid
air cells.  There is no evidence of chronic microhemorrhages.
IMPRESSION:  Multiple acute subcortical infarction in both
cerebral
hemispheres as described above.  No mass effect or
hydrocephalus.

EEG [**6-29**]
This is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG because of
intermittent runs of bifrontocentral rhythmic slowing. In
addition,
there is excess slow activity admixed with background. These
findings
are indicative of a diffuse mild to moderate encephalopathy of
non-
specific etiology. If clinical suspicion for seizure is high, a
24
hour bedside EEG monitoring is recommended. No epileptiform
discharges
or electrographic seizures are present.

EEG [**6-30**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The
background was often disorganized and included a fair amount of
drowsiness. There were also brief bursts of slowing seen
multifocally,
especially in the right frontal region, but there were no areas
of
persistent and prominent focal slowing. There were no definitely

epileptiform features. There were no electrographic seizures.

[**7-1**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The
recording showed a disorganized background, but one that reached
normal
frequencies. Much of the recording reflected drowsiness or early
sleep.
There was some slowing in several areas, but none was permanent.
There
were no epileptiform features, and there were no seizures.


Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
70 y/o female without significant past medical history who
presented initially with 4 days of cough, malaise, fever at home
dx with pneumonia via xray, admitted to MICU for increased O2
demand and acute kidney injury. Ultimately intubated for
respiratory distress and found to have Pneumococcal sepsis w/
course c/b MODS.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure:
Likely secondary to pneumonia in the setting of underlying COPD,
thus minimal reserve. Patient had progressive increasing work of
breathing ultimately requiring intubation. This was further
complicated by the development of ARDS in the setting of septic
shock, and pulmonary edema from fluid resuscitation. Her
pneumonia was treated with antibiotics (see below) and she
diuresis was started once she was HD stable. Her respiratory
status slowly improved. However, there was concern that due to
critical illness myopathy and resulting poor inspiratory effort,
she would be at high risk of re-intubation. A tracheostomy was
performed on [**6-30**]. Prior to discharge the patient was off the
ventilator with normal saturation on trach mask at FIO2 of 40%.
.
# Pneumosepsis:
Patient presented with leukopenia, bandemia, tachycardia and
tachypnea. Her CXR initially showed RLL infiltrate but evolved
quickly to involve both lungs. She shortly thereafter became
hypotensive and was aggressively fluid repleted and temporarily
required vasopressors. Her blood cultures from OSH prior to
transfer grew Peniccilin sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, as
did her sputum cultures here. She completed a 14 day course of
antitiobics on [**2134-6-27**]. She was afebrile and hemodynamically
stable prior to discharge.
.
# Acute renal failure:
Patient presented with BUN/Cr 115/6.8 in the setting of sepsis,
likely secondary to ATN, with evidence of muddy brown casts on
urine analysis. Renal ultrasound revealed no alternative cause
such as hydronephrosis. Her renal function gradually improved as
she became HD stable. Creatinine on discharge was 1.2.
.
# Thrombocytopenia
Patient had significant fall in platelet count during course of
hospitalization. Patter was concerning for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] heparin was
discontinued, argatroban was started. [**First Name3 (LF) **] antibody was
eventually negative so argatroaban discontinued and resumed
heparin for DVT prophylaxis. Thrombocytopenia ultimately felt to
be medication related. Famotidine was discontinued. Patient's
platelet count gradually normalized.
.
# Altered/Persistent Depressed mental status:
Patient had significant delay in recovery of mental status,
initially attributed to build up of benzodiazepines used for
sedation (on ventilator) in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **], evidenced by
prolonged presence of benzodiazepines in urine. Slowly improved
but some concern for waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] consciousness. MRI revealed
multiple acute subcortical infarctions in both cerebral
hemispheres. EEG was concerning for brief bursts of slowing seen
multifocally, but especially in the right frontal region
suggestive of possible seizure activity. Her EEG prior to
discharge demonstrated no seizure activity. Her clinical status
continued to improve. Outpatient neurology follow-up was
arranged.
.
# Critical Illness Myopathy/Polyneuropathy:
Patient with significant weakness and difficulty gaining motor
function in setting of sepsis and mechanical ventilation with
use of paralytics. Slowly improved throughout her course. Her
clinical status continued to improve. Outpatient neurology
follow-up was arranged.
.
# Fevers:
Patient intially febrile after completion of ATBx course,
however, repeat blood, urine cultures negative and CDiff toxin
negative and no leukocytosis. Gradually resolved and afebrile
for the 72 hours prior to discharge.
.
# Anemia:
HCT steadily trending down, could be from serial phlebotomies
vs. anemia of chronic disease. Stool guaiac negative.
B12/folate/iron studies unremarkable, hemolysis labs negative;
low ferritin and low retic index indicate hypoproliferative
anemia. Likely anemia of acute disease. Remained stable at 24.3
prior to discharge. She should have her hematocrit trended daily
initially. Our transfusion criteria had been hct < 21.

# Dental issues:
Patient noted to have poor dentition. Evaluation by general
dentistry revealed multiple broken molars which need extraction.
-> Panorex as outpatient given that patient is too weak to
stand/sit on stool independently. Will need outpatient f/u with
oral surgery as well.

# s/p Tachycardia
Patient's course was c/b developement of atrial flutter. She was
initially treated with nodal blocking [**Doctor Last Name 360**] with resulting
hypotension. She eventually responded well to amiodarone.
-> Will likely need taper off this medication given unclear need
and potential for more lung toxicity. Will need to discuss this
with her primaryoutpatient providers  upon leaving rehab.

# Transaminitis
LFTs elevated on presentation. Ultimately felt secondary to
hypotension, however in setting of persisten fevers there was
some concern for acalculous cholecystitis. RUQ ultrasound was
initially concerning for tense/enlarged gallbladder, but upon
further review by interventional radiology felt to be within
normal limits and not consistent with alcalculous cholecystitis.
LFTs were downtrending throughout the remainder of her hospital
course.
.
.
TRANSITION OF CARE
- Follow-Up Required--Patient will need repeat CT chest to
evaluate potentitial underlying pulmonary mass
--She will need follow up with Primary Care Physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] does
not have an established physician.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],

It was a pleasure participating in your care at [**Hospital1 771**]. You were admitted to the medical ICU
on [**2134-6-13**] with pneumonia causing severe systemic infection and
respiratory failure. You were intubated and treated with
antibiotics. Your course was complicated by kidney failure which
caused your body to become severely fluid overloaded, and by
severe muscle weakness caused by long ICU stay. You were too
weak to be directly extubated so instead you had a tracheostomy
(breathing tube placed in your neck). Your symptoms slowly and
steadily improved with treatment and you are now ready for
discharge to a rehab facility where you will have frequent
physical therapy to help you regain your strength.
.
Please attend the follow-up appointment listed below with
dentistry (for dental x-rays and to possibly have some broken
teeth pulled). Also please attend the neurology appointment
listed below, to follow up on your weakness and the changes on
your brain MRI.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
1. STOPPED quinidine.
2. STARTED amiodarone 200mg by mouth daily for paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation
3. STARTED heparin 5000 units subcutaneous three times daily
(continue until your mobility improves, rehab doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **]
decide when you can stop)
4. STARTED colace and senna for constipation
5. STARTED maalox-diphenhydramine-lidocaine 15-30mL by mouth
every 4 hours as needed for mouth/throat pain
6. STARTED miconazole powder three applications per day for rash
