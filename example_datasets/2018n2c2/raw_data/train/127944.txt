Pneumococcal vaccination. There was no rash, bruising, or mouth
sores. Her husband had a mild "cold" a few days before her.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) 61064**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with obtundation after several
days of URI symptoms - she was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. A CSF
examination revealed Hemophilus influenza meningitis and she was
cotniued on Ceftriaxone, after Vancomycin and Acyclovir were
discontinued. Her neurologic status improved dramatically and
she recovered full function. However, her course was complicated
by persistent fatigue, hyponatremia (deemed secondary to
meningitis-related SIADH), fever, leukocytosis and an
inflammatory CSF. Follow-up head imaging showed a right frontal
sinus opacification with possible right frontal osteomyeltis.
Her right frontal sinus was surgically evaluated and drained.
Her fevers persisted and no clear alternate source of infection
was found - in her liver, blood, urine (although she had urine
with yeast and no signs of inflammation), or chest.

1. Bacterial Meningitis/Fever: Again, the patient presented with
obtundation and an inflammatory CSF after URI symptoms. She was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for a short course and improved
dramatically on Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin and Acyclovir. Once
Hemophilus influenza was cultured from her admission CSF and
BCXRs, Vancomycin and Acyclovir were discontinued. Although she
improved neurologically, she had persistent fever and increased
serum WBCs. Repeat-LPs showed increased CSF WBCs (to 2500). She
also had persistent tachycardia, presumed secondary to fever.
Her antibiotics were changed to Meropenem, Levofloxacin and then
empiric Vancomycin. Head and spine imaging showed opacification
of the left frontal sinus, possible frontal osteomyelitis and
possible underlying meningeal enhancement, but no abscesses. Her
distal thecal sac and cauda equina were markedly enhancing and
her cauda equina nerve roots were markedly thickened. These
findings were consistent with meningitis. Her right frontal
sinus was surgically evaluated by ENT and drains were placed. Of
note, no purulent material drained from her sinus; she had only
marked mucosal edema. A repeat CSF cytology showed decreasing
WBC and increasing glucose, indicating overall improving
meningitis. Her persistent fever was thought to be [**1-8**] drug
fever from meropenem, as a screen for other sources of infection
 (UA/UCXR/BCXR/CXR/Liver CT) was negative.  Given signs of
improving meningitis by CSF studies and likely drug fever from
meropenem, meropenem was d/c and the pt was placed back on
levoflox with good effect.  Fever resolved after 48 hours off
meropenem, and there no signs of active infection after starting
levoflox.  At the time of d/c, the pt has been afebrile > 48
hours and is near her neurologic baseline on levoflox.  She will
continue levofloxacin after d/c until f/u with [**Hospital **] clinic.

2. Hyponatremia: She was euvolemic to hypovolemic and had a
hypotonic serum. Her sodim levels downtrended intiailly with
normal saline hydration and she nadired at 123. Her clinical
picture and urine electrolytes were consitent with SIADH in
setting of meningitis. She improved slightly with fluid
restriction but also required small boluses of hypertonic
saline.  Renal service was consulted and recommended salt
tablets. She was treated w/ NaCl 3gm PO TID, resulting in marked
improvement in hyponatremia.  At d/c, she is asymptomatic w/
stable sodium.  She will need to continue fluid restriction to <
1 L per day after d/c, and will also continue NaCl tablets until
f/u with her PCP.

3. LDH/ALK PHOS/AST Elevation: She had an incidental rise in
these values in the middle of her course. They were checked as a
screen given her persistent fever. It was possibly related to
high-dose Levofloxacin liver toxicity.  An abdominal CT was
negative for abscess.  After levoflox was resumed towards the
end of her hospital course, LFTs were followed and were stable.
She will require ongoing monitoring of LFTs while taking
levoflox.

4. Left Diagphragmatic Hernia: This was discovered incidentally
on chest x-ray. She was seen by surgery and a likely congenital
(Bochdalek) diaphragatic hernia was diagnosed, without obvious
lung aplasia or dysfunction. She was slotted for follow-up with
surgery as an outpatient for possible elective correction.

5. Hearing loss: she has bilateral hearing loss at the time of
d/c, likely [**1-8**] meningitis.  ENT recommends audiological
evaluation after d/c, w/ close follow-up for 6 months after
resolution of meningitis.  She will f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic after d/c
for ongoing evaluation.

6. Hypothyroidism: controlled w/ her outpt dose of levoxyl
during her admission.

7. Code status was full code during this admission.

Discharge Instructions:
1) Please take your temperature twice daily (morning and early

confusion, trouble breathing, chest pain or severe headache.
Call your doctor if you have a temperature higher than 101
degrees F.

Followup Instructions:
Audiology (Hearing) testing - [**4-1**], 1:45 pm at Dr. [**Name (NI) 61066**] office, [**Hospital **] Medical Building, [**Location (un) 61067**]. Follow-up appointment for frontal sinus
drain with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to follow at 2:30 pm, same location.
Please arrive around 15 min before your first appointment.

Call Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] general surgery [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6439**]
regarding thoracic hernia repair (repair would potentially
prevent hernia from causing obstruction). Repair could
potentially be performed laproscopically, call the office to
come discuss the surgical options in an office visit.
