Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
fever and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 54yo M with Crohn's disease s/p multiple surgeries
with resultant short gut syndrome [**12-22**] to colectomy and ileostomy
and TPN dependency who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation of low grade fevers, history of multiple line
infections, MV endocarditis and osteomyelitis for which the pt
is on chronic vancomycin for last 4 years, hickman for TPN, now
present w/ fever and hypotension.
.
At home he became febrile (24 hr nursing care) w/ to 103.4. His
nurse called Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (ID)on [**8-23**] who was notified
that he developed fever to 101 but subsequently deferveced. He
was instructed to call back if recurrent fever. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was
called back later that his temp was 103 and she instructed him
to go to the ED. He also had +fatigue. He had decreased activity
and appetite. + Dyspnea w/any exertion.
.
He was recently admit to [**Hospital1 **] 2 weeks ([**Date range (1) 8403**]) ago for fever -
work up for etiology neg. Durint that admission, he had no
leukocytosis. CXR was negative for pneumonia. All blood cultures
were negative to date, including cultures for yeast, mycolytic
infections and for M. furfur. Urine culture was negative. TEE
was negative for endocarditis. CT of the cspine and bone scan
were negative for osteomyelitis. MRI showed subtle signal
changes which may suggest chronic osteomyelitis but no prior MRI
was available for comparision( last one was in [**2193**], when he did
not have osteo).His Hickman was felt to be free of infection, so
it was not pulled.
.
He denies any headache, neck pain, CP, chills, lightheadedness,
headache, cough/sputum production, or change in bowel or urinary
habits (burning, frequency, etc.). He also has noticed no
erythema, tenderness, or swelling around his Hickman line (last
changed [**2196-7-21**]), though he notes that his previous line
infections have also been without external/visible changes. He
has no sick contacts or recent travel.
.
In the ED, he had bld cultures sent. Vanco and zosyn was given
(pt was already on vanco qod). ID was notified. CXR no evidence
no focal infiltrate or change from prior CXR. BP 70s/40s. 2L NS.
BP improved to 80-90s/40s.He did not have any signs of distress
and was mentating within his normal range Small rim of erythema
around Hickman, but obvious pus. Stoma was WNL.
.
He was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring for
hypotension.

RUQ U/S:
FINDINGS: The patient is status post cholecystectomy. There is
no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The common
duct measures 6 mm in diameter, which is not significantly
changed, allowing for differences in technique. The main portal
vein shows appropriate hepatopetal flow. No focal liver lesions
are identified, and the echotexture of the liver appears normal.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of biliary obstruction.
.
FRONTAL CHEST: Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable,
with mild cardiomegaly. No focal consolidations are identified
within the lungs. No evidence of pleural effusion. Multiple
right-sided rib fractures again seen. Right-sided central venous
line with tip overlying the distal SVC. Cervical fusion hardware
again noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process or
significant change from prior study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Fever: Blood culture and urine cultures were sent. CXR on
admission did not show focal infiltrate. He was started on vanco
(increased from chronic qod to qd) and zosyn (per discussion w/
ID). His recent hosp admission record [**7-26**] was reviewed and
showed extensive infectious workup which was unrevealing
(including MRI c-spine, which revealed no significant new
changes; neg bone scan; negative blood cultures; negative TEE).
GI and ID were concerned that his line (hickman placed in [**7-25**])
was the source of his fever. He has never had anything cultured
from the line and his cultures are again negative, though his
chronic vancomycin may be suppressing the organism. ID
recommended his home TPN be cultured (including M furfur).
Given negative cultures, the zosyn was discontinued and his
vancomycin was returned to [**Location **] dosing.  The patient remained
afebrile x 24 hours and was thus discharged home with
instructions to continue checking his temperature at least 2
times per day.

Hypotension-Pt was initially hypotensive to SBP 70s in the ED.
He responded quickly to a number of 500cc IVF boluses over the
initial 48 hrs. His BP meds were initially held.  He will
follow-up with his primary care doctor for a repeat blood
pressure check to consider restarting his lisinopril given his
history of MR.  His norvasc and lasix are also being held.

Hyperbilirubinemia/Elevated ALk Phos- His alk phos and bili were
elevated on admission (rest of his LFTs was relatively stable).
He did not complain of pain. RUQ u/s recommended by GI was
unremarkable.  Labs were improving at the time of discharge

Anemia-He has baseline anemia in the range of 35-37. His hct
slowly drifted down to low 30s on admission. Hemolysis labs were
sent but were normal.  Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic
disease.  Folate and B12 were normal.

Nutrition-Pt was initially given standard TPN as his home
formula was not available. Dr. [**Name (NI) 79**] (pt 's own GI specialist)
came by on [**8-25**] and gave specific instruction on the
non-standard TPN formulation.

Facility:
[**Location (un) **] home therapy

Discharge Diagnosis:
hypotension
fever
acute renal failure
hyperbilirubinemia
anemia of chronic disease
history of short gut syndrome on TPN
history of cervical osteomyelitis on chronic vancomycin


Discharge Condition:
good: afebrile, wbc down, creatinine back to baseline


Discharge Instructions:
Please call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] or go to the emergency room for
temperature > 101, low blood pressure, decreased urine output,
weight gain > 3 pounds, chest pain, back/neck pain, or other
concerning symptoms.

Please store your TPN in a separate mini-refrigerator that you
should bleach one time per week to prevent TPN contamination.

Please continue your home TPN, as previously prescribed.  No
changes have been made.

Please stop taking supplemental IVF each day.

Please follow-up with your primary care doctor or his nurse
practitioner within 1 week for a blood pressure check and labs
including kidney function (creatinine) to consider restarting
your lisinopril.  For now, please do not take that medication.
Please also defer starting your amlodipine and lasix for now.
If your weight increases > 3 pounds, please call your doctor to
discuss restarting the lasix.

Please continue getting weekly labs each Monday, which are faxed
to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 79**].

You were hospitalized for fever of concern for infection. You
were given zosyn (antibiotics) in addition to vancomycin. Blood
and urine cultures were drawn and your TPN was being cultured
for possible source of infection. Infectious disease was
consulted. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79**] also came by to evaluate you. A right upper
quadrant ultrasound showed no dilation of your bile ducts,
despite elevated bilirubin which has since improved.  Your blood
count is stable.
