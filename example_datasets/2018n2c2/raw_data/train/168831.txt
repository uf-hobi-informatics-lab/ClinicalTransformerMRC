swelling of lips

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
47F with asthma/COPD, atopic dermatitis, HTN on ACEI, GERD who
comes with facial swelling. She was in her prior state of health
until yesterday afternoon when she started noticing mild facial
swelling. She went to bed and was doing fine, but when she woke
up at the normal time she noticed worsening of her lip swelling
to the point she was unable to open her mouth. She denies any
wheezing, stridor, shortness of breath and states that has been
on Lisinopril 20 mg for long time. She denies fever, chills,
changes in her voice, drooling, neck pain, hoarseness or any
other upper airway symptoms.
.
Of note, patient was recently admitted for abdominal pain and
negative work up including CT abdomen, right upper quadrant
ultrasound, and HIDA scan were all performed and within normal
limits. Diet was advanced without difficulty, and patient was
placed on aggressive bowel regimen with daily bowel movement.
She was discharged home 3 days ago.
.
In the ER her initial VS were T 97.4 F, HR 58 BPM, BP 126/79
mmHg, RR 16 X', SpO2 100% on RA. She was breathing comfortably,
but there was a lot of difficulty examining her mouth. ENT and
anesthesia were called to assess patient. ENT tried scoping her
to assess for vocal cord swelling, but she did not tolerate
procedure secondarely to anxiety and dyscomfort. ER tried giving
5 mg of midazolam and re-doing procedure, but patient was still
unable to tolerate it. Then, given patient's breathing being
stable ENT decided to preoceed with medications only and
observation for 1 hour in the ER. Pt received 125 mg of IV
solumedrol, 20 mg of IV famotidine, 25 mg of IV diphenydramine
and epipen x2 (its unclear if first one went in, so [**Name (NI) **] repeated
the dose). She was stable for 1 hour and then is admitted to the
ICU for monitoring. She is has a tough access and ER could only
get a small IV in R forearm (that is why they gave epineprhine
IM).

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Angioedema - Patient has bilateral impressive lip and cheek
swelling. She had been on an ACEI for "long time" many years.
There was no change in diet or specific trigger however it seems
that she started Naprosyn the day prior to admission.  She was
admitted to the ICU for monitoring after failed attempts of
visualizing the vocal cords.  She was been seen by allergy for
likely naproxen induced angioedema. She was started on
steroids/antihistamines without much improvement. Her ACE-i was
stopped as well as Naproxen and NSAIDs in general.  Her
respiratory status remained stable and her diet was advanced
after transfer to the floor on [**5-28**].
.

Albuterol and on day of discharge Montelukast was restarted
.

was held and her beta-blocker was not restarted due to
persistent HR in the 50s. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6**] [**Last Name (un) **] can be considered in >1 month
