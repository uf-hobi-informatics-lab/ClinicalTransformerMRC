Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
GI Bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 y/o female recently dx with AML on supportive
treatment only, on coumadin for atrial fibrillation and h/o TIA,
who presented to the ED with c/o maroon-colored stools x 6 days
and fatigue with SOB x several days. Pt noted blood also mixed
in with stool, but denies any increase in frequency of stool. No
abd pain, n/v/hematemesis or other changes in bowel habits.
.
In the ED, labs were significant for a Hct of 15.8, WBC of 45.8,
and INR of 7.7. Maroon stool, guiac positive in rectum but NG
lavage negative. Pt was hemodynamically stable throughout. She
was given 1 U PRBC, 2 U FFP, and 5 mg SC vit K. GI was consulted
in the ED and feels this may be a LGIB, but also could be a
UGIB. Conversation with PCP and family lead to decision of
tagged RBC scan to attempt localization of site in an effort to
avoid invasive procedures, including EGD/colonoscopy given
comorbid conditions. Tagged RBC scan demonstrated brisk bleeding
from the cecum.
.
Currently, pt fatigued, but otherwise denies other sx including
LH/dizziness, h/a, vision changes, URI sx,
SOB/palpitations/chest pain, abd pain, n/v,
weakness/numbness/loss of sensation, dysuria. No further BM's
since yesterday.
