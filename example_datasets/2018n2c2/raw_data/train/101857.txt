History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 44yo F with ETOH abuse, HCV, h/o IVDA presented
to OSH with intermittent hematemasis and on [**2140-7-14**] is for TIPS.
Pt has been having black tarry stools and hematemasis since

.
Imaging at OSH: Liver u/s with doppler: Coarse echogenic liver,
suggestive of fatty liver but cannot exclude a micronodular
cirrhosis in the appropriate clinical setting. Mild
splenomegaly. patent portal vein. no vevidence of varices or
portal hypertension. A small amount of ascites. 14.cm
echotextures. Spleen 13.8cm.
.
CXR [**2140-7-16**]: RSC in SVC. No acute cardiopulm processes.
.
Abdominal ultrasound [**2140-7-18**]:
IMPRESSION:  Very limited study.  TIPS stent is patent but
velocities could not be obtained due to respiratory motion and
therefore satisfactory baseline data could not be obtained.
.
Feeding tube placement [**2140-7-20**]:
IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of post-pyloric feeding tube
in the fourth portion of the duodenum.
.
Abdominal Ultrasound [**2140-7-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Patent TIPS with slightly increased velocities.
2.  New 4 cm echogenic wedge-shaped structure in the right lobe.
 Given its development since examinations of 9 and 11 days ago,
it is unlikely to be a mass, however, MRI can be performed on a
nonemergent basis for further characterization.
3.  Slight increase in ascites.
.
Portable CXR [**2140-7-31**]:
There has been interval extubation and removal of right-sided
vascular
catheter and sheath.  Right PICC line has been placed,
terminating in the
proximal superior vena cava.  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits
of normal in size allowing for low lung volumes.  Previously
present mild pulmonary edema has resolved.  There is improved
aeration in the left retrocardiac region with residual patchy
opacity containing several air bronchograms.  Although possibly
due to resolving atelectasis and dependent edema, infectious
pneumonia is also possible in the appropriate setting.  Minor
right basilar atelectasis is noted as well as a possible small
right pleural effusion.
.
Renal U/S [**2140-7-31**]:
FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 12.2 cm and the left 11.2
cm.  The renal parenchymal thickness and echogenicity are
normal.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or calculi.
Small amount of ascites is noted.
.
IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable renal ultrasound.
.
EGD [**2140-8-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. A feeding tube passing into duodenum was noted. No
significant varices noted in esophagus. Granularity, friability,
erythema, congestion, abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance
in the whole stomach
2. Duodenum was not entered due to the feeding tube. No bleeding
noted in stomach.
3. Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Alcoholic Cirrhosis/Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis: Admitted to
[**Hospital3 **] from outside hospital after recent variceal bleed
s/p variceal banding. Here, repeat EGD was performed which
showed previously banded esophageal varices and gastric varices
with stigmata of recent bleeding. No new bands placed.
Subsequently underwent uncomplicated TIPS on [**2140-7-16**]. Completed 5
day course of octreotide and 7 day course of levofloxacin for
SBP prophylaxis. Unfortunately, patient continued to
decompensate, with rising bilirubin and INR. She was treated
with lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy. Ultrasound [**7-18**]
and [**7-20**] both showed patent TIPS.
.
Given rising bili/INR, she was given a trial of pentoxyfilline
and ursodiol for suspected acute alcoholic hepatitis.
Corticosteroids not given because of recent bleeding. However,
her synthetic function did not improve, and her creatinine
subsequently rose from 0.6 to 3.0. A diagnostic paracentesis was
performed (on [**7-29**]), which demonstrated no evidence of SBP. Her
pentoxyfilline and ursodiol were discontinued as there was no
clear improvement on treatment. She was started empirically on
octreotide/midodrine for possible hepatorenal syndrome.
Nephrotoxic medications were held and she was given volume
repletion both with normal saline and albumin. Creatinine
subsequently improved to 1.2-1.4 at the time of discharge.
.
For nutritional support a post-pyloric feeding tube was placed
and tube feeds were intiated per nutrition recommendations. She
will be discharged for continued nutritional support to meet
caloric goals.
.
She was seen by social work for substance abuse support. In
addition, she was provided with information on post-discharge
support services.
.
MELD at time of discharge was 33, driven by a bilirubin of 19.8,
creatinine of 1.4, and an INR of 2.9.
.
Diuretics held given renal failure and lack of ascites on
ultrasound, s/p TIPS.
.
# s/p Upper GI bleed: Initial hct was 34 which drifted down to
25 then 21.9 on day of admission. She underwent EGD a few hours
after arrival, and it showed 3 esophageal variceal bands and
gastric varices which had recent stigmata of bleeding but no
active bleeding. She was supported with blood products and
underwent TIPS as above. Her hematocrit subsequently remained
stablized with no further evidence of active GI bleeding. Repeat
EGD on [**2140-8-3**] prior to discharge showed no significant varices
in the esophagus. There was noted granularity, friability,
erythema, congestion, abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance
in the whole stomach consistent with portal gastropathy, but no
active bleeding.
.
# Acute renal insufficiency:  As outlined above, developed
rising creatinine, initially concerning for hepatorenal syndrome
(HRS), with  UOP <30 cc/hour in setting of known ETOH cirrhosis.
 Started empirically on midodrine/octreotide. However urine
sodium >10, so was not completely consistent with HRS.
Paracentesis [**7-29**] demonstrated no evidence of bacterial
peritonitis. Urinalysis demonstrated no eosinophils. Ultrasound
on [**7-30**] showed no hydronephrosis, but did show a new echogenic
wedge shaped structure in right lobe, of unclear clinical
significance.  No other evidence of infarcts/ischemia were
noted, and lupus anti-coagulant was sent and was negative as
well.  Renal service was consulted and nephrotoxic medications
were held. She was repleted with IV fluids and renal function
subsequently improved, with creatinine trending down from 3.0 to
1.4, with good urine output.
.
# Hypotension: Initially likely from GIB, hypovolemia.
Subsequently remained stable in low 90's-100's systolic, in
setting of chronic liver disease.  Initially started on Zosyn
and Vancomycin as well as Levaquin for concern for infectious
etiology, however antibiotics subsequently discontinued as no
infectious source identified. Of note, blood cultures from [**7-17**]
grew 1/4 bottles STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.  This was
considered contaminant and repeat blood cultures were negative.
.
# HCV: Repeat HCV viral load on this admission ([**2140-7-21**]) showed
no HCV viral RNA.
.
# DM II: On Metformin prior to hospital admission. Covered as
inpatient on sliding scale insulin and glargine. Discharged on
glargine 24units/night, and the patient demonstrated how to use
SSI at home. Metformin and alternative oral hypoglycemics
contra-indicated in setting of her cirrhosis.
.
# HIT antibody positive: HIT antibody sent due to
thrombocytopenia, and was noted to be positive on this
admission; however, she could not be anti-coagulated given her
recent variceal bleed and coagulopathy from liver disease. All
heparin products were held. Platelet count remained low
secondary to liver disease, but stable, with no clear evidence
of clinical thrombosis.
.
# Nutritional Deficiency: Post-pyloric dobhoff placed for
nutritional support to meet caloric goals. Tube feeds will
continue upon discharge with outpatient services arranged.
.
