Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Zosyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Peripherally insterted central catheter
Nasogastric tube


History of Present Illness:
85 M with h/o CVA s/p recent CEA, DM2, CKD and HTN who presents
from [**Hospital1 1501**] with respiratory distress. Although it is not clear
from discharge summary, recent hospitalization complicated by
SICU stay for PNA vs CHF. Unclear if patient was reintubated but
was started on levofloxacin and diamox. Discharged ([**11-28**]) to
complete 2 week course of ciprofloxacin.
.
ROS: denies shortness of breath, fevers, chest pain. reports
only feeling worn and not well. + achy, tired, malaise. Denies
DOE (walks >1 block prior to previous admission with cane), PND.
Stable 2 pillow orthopnea. No ankle edema.
.
ED Course:
In ED, afebrile but briefly hypotension and responded to small
fluid bolus. CXR showed likely PNA and the patient was given a
dose of vanc/CTx. Requiring non-rebreather to maintain
oxygenation. Prior to coming up to the ICU, the patient went
into a fib with RVR (HR to 140s). Started on dilt drip.
.
MICU Course:
Treated for HAP with vanc/levo/flagyl. Respiratory status
improved with decreasing O2 requirement and afebrile. Weaned off
dilt gtt, AFib remained well-controlled on PO beta blocker and
spontaneously converted to sinus. One episode OB+ 'black' stool
but stable Hct and hemodynamics stable.
.
[**Hospital1 **] Course:
He was called out to the floor on [**12-4**]. On the floor he appeared
dyspneic and was diuresed for pulmonary edema, but dyspnea not
completely resolved. He had negative LENIs and V/Q scan with
intermediate probability PE. He also continued to tell the team
that "I want to die". SW was consulted and ritalin was started.
Pt was not taking in POs and creatinine also started trending up
again.  [**2131-12-12**] pt was found to have BP 72/40 and decreased UOP.
He was given a 500 cc bouls and Bps initially trended up to
82/50 and then down to 70/40. He then received an additonal 1 L
fluid bolus and was transferred to the ICU.
.
MICU Course:
He received 7 liters of IVF with improvement of his blood
pressure and subsequent improvement in his mental status.
Psychiatry and neurology were consulted; his perseveration on "I
want to die. Hurry up." did not seem consistent with a diagnosis
of depression, but his behavior did raise concern of frontal
release . Neurology Celexa was stopped as it has been reported
to cause hypotension and is without immediate benefit to the
patient, and at the recommendation of psychiatry, ritalin was
stopped as well.

.
EKG: sinus, 100bpm, LAD, freq PACs, IVCD similar to prior
.
CXR, portable ([**12-1**])- Large hiatal hernia. Increasing air space
opacities within the left lung and right lower lung zone. There
is no pneumothorax. There are no pleural effusions.
.
TTE ([**12-4**])- The left atrium is normal in size. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV
diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
CXR ([**12-6**])- The right PICC line tip terminates in the SVC.  The
large hiatal hernia is again demonstrated.  There is worsening
of bilateral infiltrates, suggesting increased degree of
pulmonary edema and also of the underlying pneumonia cannot be
excluded, especially in the right lower lobe and left upper
lobe. Bilateral pleural effusion is small-to-moderate.
.
Bilateral LE U/S ([**12-7**]): No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in
either lower extremity.
.
V/Q scan ([**12-7**]):
INTERPRETATION:  Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol
in 8 views demonstrate central  deposition of the
radiopharmaceutical, due to the turbulent flow. There are
widespread ventilatory abnormalities in RML, RLL, LUL, LLL,
predominantly at lung bases. Perfusion images in the same 8
views show similar pattern of perfusion abnormaliies, also most
pronounced at the bases. Chest x-ray shows diffuse bilateral
infiltrates with similar distribution pattern.
IMPRESSION: Matched perfusion and chest X-ray findings.
Intermediate likelihood ratio for pulmonary embolism.
.
Chest CT, non-contrast ([**12-10**]):
1.  Intrathoracic stomach.
2.  Multifocal pneumonia, most likely aspiration.  Small
bilateral pleural
effusions and subcarinal mediastinal adenopathy, presumably
reactive.
3.  Calcific cholelithiasis.  No evidence of cholecystitis.
.
Head CT, non-contrast ([**12-12**]):
FINDINGS:  The posterior fossa is not well seen on today's
examination
secondary to patient motion artifact.  There is no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage. Old areas of hypodensity seen within
the left external capsule are unchanged compared to [**2131-11-24**],
consistent with chronic lacunar infarction.  A lacunar infarct
within the right caudate nucleus is also unchanged in
appearance. There is no evidence of intracranial mass lesion,
hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.  The
density values of the brain parenchyma are within normal limits.
 The surrounding soft tissues and osseous structures are
unremarkable. The paranasal sinuses appear clear.
IMPRESSION:    No new areas of acute infarction identified.  The
previously reported tiny left parafalcine subdural hematoma seen
on MRI is not seen on today's examination, likely secondary to
interval resorption.
.
Brain, Head, Neck MRI/MRA ([**12-15**]):
FINDINGS:  BRAIN MRI:
Comparison was made with the previous MRI examination of
[**2131-11-23**].  The
previously seen subtle increased signal in the right parafalcine
region in the frontal lobe on diffusion images is again
visualized and appears to be due to T2 shine through.  Mild
periventricular changes of small vessel disease are seen.  There
is no evidence of midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus
seen.  There is moderate brain atrophy seen.  On diffusion
images no evidence of acute infarct is noted.  The previously
identified interhemispheric parafalcine subdural hematoma has
also resolved since the previous MRI examination with subtle
changes remaining in this region.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute infarct or new finding since
the previous MRI study.  Resolution of previously noted subdural
hematoma.  No mass effect or hydrocephalus.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
MRA demonstrates a normal flow signal in the anterior
circulation.  The A1
segment of the left anterior cerebral artery is hypoplastic but
both A2
segments are well visualized.  There is mild irregularity of the
flow signal seen in the basilar artery which could indicate mild
atherosclerotic disease. The distal right vertebral artery is
not visualized which appears to be secondary to the artery
ending in posterior inferior cerebellar artery, a normal
variation.
IMPRESSION:  Mild atherosclerotic disease otherwise unremarkable
study.
MRA OF THE NECK:
The 3D time-of-flight MRA of the neck is limited by motion.  No
evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis seen.
IMPRESSION:  Somewhat motion-limited normal MRA of the neck.
.
Right upper extremity U/S ([**12-16**]): Occlusive thrombus in the
right basilic vein surrounding indwelling PICC line.  No deep
venous thrombus in the right upper extremity is identified.
.
EEG ([**12-18**]):
FINDINGS:
BACKGROUND: A 9 Hz disorganized posterior predominant rhythm was
noted
in the waking state, which attenuated with eye opening.
HYPERVENTILATION: Contraindicated due to mental status.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Produced no activation of the
record.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from the waking to drowsy states,
but did
not attain stage II sleep.
CARDIAC MONITOR: A generally regular rhythm was noted, with an
average
rate of 90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION: This is a normal EEG in the waking and drowsy
states. No
focal, lateralizing or epileptiform features were noted.
.
CXR ([**12-19**]): Multifocal opacities consistent with multifocal
pneumonia/aspiration are overall stable with slight clearing in
the left upper lobe and slight worsening in the right upper
lobe.  Interval removal of the nasogastric tube.  Left lower
lobe atelectasis is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 M with h/o CVA s/p recent CEA, DM2, CKD and HTN who presented
with hypoxic respiratory distress [**1-4**] PNA and new-onset AFib
with RVR.
.
# Pneumonia: Multifocal PNA, treated for aspiration and HAP
given recent intubation / hospital stay with vanc/levo/flagyl x
11 days, vanc/zosyn/flagyl x 2 days, vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/flagyl x 4 days.
LENIs negative, V/Q scan intermediate probability PE. Pulm
consulted but rec no bronch as respiratory status improved. He
was taken off antibiotics x 2 days and spiked fever, tachypnic,
WBC increased from 10 -> 22 (C. diff negative), then decreased
11 after starting linezolid and levofloxacin (to complete 14 day
course on [**1-1**]). Respiratory status improved with diminished O2
requirement and resolution of tachypnea. Followup with PCP.
.
# Personality change: ?depression vs. frontal disinhibition.
Patient had been expressing wishes to die intermittently.
Occasional sundowning. Psych and neuro consulted. CT head shows
resorbed subdural hematoma, MR brain negative for acute CVA. EEG
was normal with no seizure activity. Intermittenly uncooperative
and somnolent, then spontaneously A&Ox3; likely [**1-4**] delerium
from toxic-metabolic cause in setting of significant frontal
atrophy noted on head CT. Tried on ritalin (d/c'd [**1-4**] concern
for MS change), celexa (d/c'd [**1-4**] concern for hypotension), and
remeron (d/c'd [**1-4**] concern for MS change, risk of serotonin
syndrome while on linezolid). Occasionally the patient developed
non-threatening hallucinations thought to be [**1-4**] toxic-metabolic
causes. If he develops agitation, psych recommends considering a
trial of haldol 0.5mg prn.
.
# Paroxysmal AFib: RVR to 140's at presentation, started on dilt
drip while in the ED, which was then weaned off in MICU.
Remained in sinus rhythm the rest of hospital course. No prior
h/o AFib per patient (confirmed with PCP). CHADS score 3, and
therefore would probably benefit from anticoagulation, but given
fall risk, recent SDH, comorbidites this was deferred (discussed
with PCP). Monitored on telemetry with no repeat events.
Continued metoprolol with good BP control; occasionally sinus
tachy likely [**1-4**] volume depleteion, stress, and infection.
.
# ARF on CRF: Resolved. Baseline Cre ~2.2; was 2.0 at discharge.
Most likely pre-renal azotemia in setting of hypovolemia (poor
intake, diarrhea) and responded to IVFs. Medications were
renally dosed.
.
# DM2: Diet-controlled. Hypoglycemic on transfer to MICU in
setting of starting NPH for persistant hyperglycemia; NPH was
then discontinued. Fingersticks were eventually discontinued as
serum glucose was well-controlled.
.
# CVA: s/p CEA, stable (followed by [**Doctor Last Name 1391**]). MR brain negative
for acute event. Vascular surgery made aware patient admitted,
no active issues. Cont ASA, Aggrenox.
.
# Cardiovascular: No documented h/o CAD or CHF but multiple risk
factors. Preserved EF on echo, although possible diastolic
dysfunction. CXR after MICU transfer with mild to moderate
volume overload and the patient was gently diuresed until
euvolemic. Cont ASA, statin, BB.
.
# Anemia: OB +ve stool noted while patient was in MICU, and then
intermittent positivity during rest of hospital stay.
?gastritis. Received 1 unit pRBC during admission with
appropriate increase in Hct, which remained stable. Started on
PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Recent c-scope (2 years ago per patient) negative;
denies ever having EGD or h/o GI bleeding. Would consider
pursuing outpatient GI followup.
.
# Coagulopathy: Elevated INR 1.4-1.5 at presentation likely
nutritional given poor PO intake. LFTs normal and
albumin/prealbumin low supporting nutritional deficiency.
Received vitamin K PO with slight improvement.
.
# Rash: Likely drug reaction [**1-4**] zosyn as this was only new
recent medication around the time the rash began. Serum eos
normal. The rash resolved after 1 week. Mild pruritis was
well-controlled with topical anti-itch cream.
.
# Hypernatremia: Resolved. Hypovolemic at presentation (~3.5L
H2O deficit), serum Na+ normalized with free water boluses but
recurred when stopped from poor PO intake and again improved
with free water (3L deficit). PO intake encouraged.
.
# Hypotension: Resolved after 8L of fluids in MICU. Likely [**1-4**]
hypovolemia from poor PO intake and diarrhea. Diarrhea also
resolved (C. diff neg x 3). Continued to supplement with IV
hydration and intermittent hypodermoclysis given poor POs.
.
# Hyperthyroidism: Mild with slighlty elevated free T4, slightly
depressed TSH. No thyroid nodules on exam. Difficult to
interpret in acute care setting, and therefore would suggest
rechecking as outpatient.
.
# Activity: PT worked with patient frequently. Goal OOB to chair
daily. Will likely need significant rehabilitation and will
benefit greatly from increased mobility and independence.
.
# FEN: Prethickened liquids / ground solids, PO intake
encouraged; Briefly with NG tube on tube feeds but d/c'd
according to family wishes due to somnolence and mental status
changes; Continue aspiration precautions; Repleted 'lytes prn
