Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
male with known ST elevation, MI, status post elective cath
complicated by hypotension and bradycardia who was
transferred to CCU for observation.  The patient initially
presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Medical Center on [**2163-1-14**] with
chest pain radiating to the jaw.  He was found to have
increased troponin of 1.76, was given Nitroglycerin and
remained pain free over the next three days at the outside
hospital on Aspirin, Plavix and Nitroglycerin prn.  He was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
elective catheterization on [**2163-1-17**].  The catheterization
showed double occlusion of PDA, no intervention was done.
The patient was transferred to post-op area where he became
hypotensive after continuous pressure to his groin was
applied in order to stop the bleeding from the femoral
artery.  The patient was noticed to have groin hematoma and
angiocele was attempted.  He was also given 40 mg of
Protamine in order to stop the bleeding.  At this time he
became hypotensive.  This was thought to be secondary to
vagal reflux.  He was given IV fluids and Dopamine after
which he developed upper body pruritic rash.  Because of the
concern for anaphylaxis secondary to dye Protamine, the
patient was given 120 mg of Solu-Medrol and Benadryl as well
as Promethazine and Pepcid.  CT of the head and abdomen were
obtained in order to rule out retroperitoneal or head
bleeding.  Both were negative.  Vascular surgery was
consulted and the patient was transferred to the CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for lung cancer.  The
patient had left lung cancer in [**2147**] and right lung cancer in

diagnosed in [**2160**].  Also has a history of hypertension,
peripheral vascular disease and hypercholesterolemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU for
observation and treatment of possible anaphylactic reaction.
Solu-Medrol and Nitro were continued over the next 24 hours.
The patient's mental status cleared the next morning.  His
