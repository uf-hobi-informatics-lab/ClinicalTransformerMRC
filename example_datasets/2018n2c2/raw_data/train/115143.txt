History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 64236**] is a 26 y/o man with IDDM for 8 years who presents
with several days of nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain. Two
weeks ago, he was diagnosed with sinusitis/sinus infection and
given antibiotics. He first noticed epigastric abdominal pain
about one week ago, constant, without relation to food. It was a
strong, sharp pain that did not radiate. Notably, he had been
taking ibuprofen 800 mg q3h for headache associated with
sinusitis at that time. In past 2-3 days noticed increased
nausea with vomiting. Denies hematemesis. Notes that he last
kept something liquid down yesterday morning, but vomitted up
everything (both liqiuds and solids) through the day and night.
Thus, he came to [**Hospital1 18**] ED that night. Took insulin during that
time intermittently but this is typical for him.
.
His insulin control and FSG checking has chronically been very
poor. He admits to taking insulin about 5 times per week.
Further, when he does take it, he taked a standing dose of 10U
Reg and 30U of 70/30. He takes his FSG about 1 per month due to
discomfort with the prick. He has chronic polyuria and
polydypsia. He reports getting regular vision checks with [**Last Name (un) **]
center and no knowledge of neuropathy, kidney disease, or eye
problems.
.
On ROS, he denies HA, changes in vision, hearing, or swallowing.
No fever, sweats, chills, weight loss. He eats very well. No CP,
palps, PND, orthopnea. No SOB, pain with breathing, cough,
wheeze. No recent bowel of bladder dysfunction. No troubles with
limb weakness, sensory changes, poor coordination. He does feel
episodes of hypoglycemia if he does not eat following insulin:
sweating, palpitations, and anxiety.

Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival to MICU, patient complaining of ongoing nausea and
epigastric pain. Vomitting X 2 was witnessed by house staff, the
second episode occurring with a small amount of hematemesis. No
subsequent hematemesis or significant Hct change. In the MICU,
he was placed on insulin drip, IVF, and electrolytes (most
notably K) were repleted as needed. His Anion Gap narrowed from
30 to 13 by transfer to floor. His FSGs were initially high 400s
and fluctuated between 200-500 in the MICU. Following
stabilization, the patient was transferred to the medical floor.
His FSG was 420 upon transfer. He was receiving standing NPH [**Hospital1 **]
and Regular ISS with meals. On floor day 1, his FSGs were in the
200s. His anion gap closed. Potassium and Phos were repleted.
The [**Last Name (un) **] center was also consulted.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Diabetic ketoacidosis, IDDM with features of insulin
resistance.


Discharge Condition:
Good


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for diabetic keto-acidosis.
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a severe and life threatening
condition that results from uncontrolled blood sugar. This
episode of DKA happened becuase you were not regularly taking
insulin and becuase your blood sugar was very high. Your recent
sinus infection could have also worsened your condition. As a
result of this condition, you required admission to the
intensive care unit. During your hospitalization, your blood
sugar, electrolytes, and metabolism, in general, were restored
to a more normal condition.

It is extremely important that you keep your blood sugars at
more normal levels or this life-threatening condition will
happen again. Also, you will develop eye problems, kidney
disease, worse leg numbness, and heart disease if your sugars
are not controlled better.

In order to control your sugars, you need to follow the Insulin
regimen that was prescribed by the [**Last Name (un) **] center. You will have
to take 2 types of insulin. You will take a dose of long acting
insulin (Lantus) every night and this dose will be constant. You
will take a dose of Humalog insulin before every meal based on
the sliding scale chart - thus you have to check your sugar at
this time.

If you find that you are unable to follow the above insulin
plan, you have to call your doctor at the [**Hospital **] clinic.

Due to your high use of Motrin before admission, you irritated
the lining of your stomach. Thus, we treated this problem with a
medicine to decrease the acid in your stomach called
pantoprazole. You should continue taking this medicine until you
see your PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 10748**] your stomach problem.

If you begin to again experience increasing nausea, vomitting,
abdominal pain, or any other concerning symptom, you should
contact your PCP or go to the ER.

Followup Instructions:
You need to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3636**] for diabetes care.
Your first appointment is [**4-29**] at 4PM. This appointment is
very important!!!

You can call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 17484**] and ask for Dr.[**Name (NI) 64238**] office if this
time does not work.

You need to schedule an appointment with you primary care doctor
within the next few weeks to followup your stomach pain after
taking Motrin.
