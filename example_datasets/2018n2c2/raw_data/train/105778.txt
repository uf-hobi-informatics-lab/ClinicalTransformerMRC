Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right- and left- heart catheterization:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Severe systemic hypetension.
.


History of Present Illness:
88 yo [**Location 7972**] F with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
known AAA (4.4x4.1cm), AV nodal disease s/p pacer placement, PVD
and AS with valve area 0.81 who presents after diagnostic right
and left heart cath with a hypotensive episode.
.
The patient presented today from home for diagnostic right and
left heart cath. Prior to the procedure, the patient was noted
to be hypertensive to 145/110. She received 5mg IV lopressor.
During the procedure, the patient was noted to be hypertensive
to >200/100. She received heparin 1000U, nitroglycerin gtt at
40mcg/min and then 80mcg/min during the procedure with some bp
response to 180/90. In the post-cath holding area after the
procedure, the patient was again hypertensive to 224/94. She
received hydralazine 10mg IV. Approximately 3 hours after the
procedure at 1:15PM the patient complained of left leg pain
described as cramping, contralateral to her groin access site on
the right. She also complained of nausea and vomiting. She was
noted at this time to have over 2L urine output in her foley
bag. Her BP was 70/palp from 162/60. She received NS bolus of
1L, zofran 4mg IV, dopamine at 5 and then 12mcg/kg/min with
improvement in her bp to 108/52. She was noted to have no
hematoma or at her right groin site and dopplerable pulses in
the distal extremities bilaterally.
.
On presentation to the ICU, the patient was noted to have a bp
141/74 off of dopamine. She complained of some mild epigastric
discomfort. She denies experiencing this pain in the past
however notes in OMR and verbal report from other physicians
describes frequent complaints of abdominal pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. She endorses DOE after 3
flights of stairs in a recent cardiovascular clinic note though
denies this currently. ROS otherwise negative in detail with the
exception of some calf cramping occurring with activity and
relieved with rest.

Right- and Left- Heart Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
patent LMCA. The LAD had no demonstrable stenosis. LCX was
non-dominant
with no significant obstructive disease. The RCA was dominant
without
critical lesions.
2. Left ventriculography showed preserved ejection fraction of
55% and
normal wall motion with small cavity suggestive of diastolic
dysfunction.
3. Abdominal aortography showed an aneurysm of about 4 cm in
size.
4. Hemodynamic assessment revealed markedly elevated systemic
pressures
of above 200 mm Hg. There was a 30 mm Hg gradient across the
aortic
valve with calculated valve are of 0.8 cm2 which was unchanged
from
prior exam. Left and right sided filling pressures were normal
and
cardiac index was preserved. Administration of intravenous
nitroglycerine did not increase PCWP and decreased systemic
blood pressure to 185 mm Hg with brisk diuresis in the lab.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Severe systemic hypetension.
.
.
ECG ([**2180-2-24**]): Atrial pacing. Left axis deviation. Left
anterior fascicular block.
Non-specific lateral and anterolateral ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the
previous tracing ventricular pacing is no longer present.
.
.
2D-[**Year (4 digits) **] ([**2180-2-17**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic
valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-12-16**],
aortic gradients and pulmonary pressures are lower but there is
still significant aortic stenosis
.
P-MIBI ([**2178-2-16**]): No anginal symptoms or ECG changes from
baseline. 1. Normal myocardial perfusion.  2. Normal left
ventricular cavity
size and function. EF 66%.
.
CT abd/pelvis ([**2179-12-21**]): 1.  44 x 41 mm abdominal aortic
aneurysm as described above with extensive atherosclerosis in
the branches of the abdominal aorta as well as ectasia of the
iliac arteries. 2. Bilateral renal cortical thinning and
bilateral renal hypodensities likely represent cysts. 3.
Uterine calcifications likely represent fibroids.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 88-year-old [**Location 7972**] woman with
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, known AAA (4.4x4.1cm), AV
nodal disease s/p pacemaker placement, PVD and AS with valve
area 0.81, who presents after diagnostic right- and left- heart
catheterization with a hypotensive episode in the setting of
multiple antihypertensive agents, 2 liter autodiuresis, and
severe abdominal pain.
.
#. Hypotensive episode - The patient experienced hypotension
post-catheterization, likely from a combination of receiving
multiple anti-hypertensives within a short amount of time
(metoprolol, nitroglycerin, and hydralazine), with a
large-volume auto-diuresis, and likely a component of vasovagal
response in the setting of severe abdominal pain. She received
approx 1.5L of volume resuscitation and her anti-hypertensives
were held. She did well clinically thereafter, with good
response in her blood pressure. Her beta-blocker was resumed at
home dose on [**2180-2-26**], which she tolerated well, and she was
started on a low-dose ACE-inhibitor as well, which she also
tolerated well. Her HCTZ was held and was not restarted. She was
discharged on [**2180-2-26**] with follow-up planned with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
in 2 weeks.
.
#. Coronary Artery Disease (ischemia) - The patient had no
significant CAD on her left-heart catheterization, and she had
no signs of active ischemia. She was maintained on her home baby
aspirin for primary prophylaxis.
.
#. Pump - The patient has a preserved EF on her most recent TTE,
with no signs of CHF currenty. She is pre-load dependent given
her valvular disease.
.
#. Rhythm - The patient has a history of high-degree AV nodal
disease s/p recent pacemaker placement. She currently has a
paced rhythm.
.
#. Valves - The patient has known severe AS with valve area 0.8.
She will have outpatient follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for further
management of her valvular disease.
.
#. Hypertension - The patient's home anti-hypertensives, HCTZ
and metoprolol, were initially held given her hypotensive
episode above. The metoprolol was re-instituted as the patient's
blood pressures improved, and she was also started on an
ACE-inhibitor prior to discharge. Her HCTZ was discontinued.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia - The patient was continued on her home
cholestyramine and Lescol.
.
#. Vascular Aneurysms - The patient has known AAA (4.3cm),
ascending thoracic aneurysm (3.5cm), and right proximal
popliteal aneurysm, all of which are followed as an outpatient.
.
#. Peripheral Vascular Disease - The patient has PVD s/p
bilateral lower extremity revascularization. She was continued
on her home baby aspirin.

You were restarted on your home metoprolol, which you tolerated
well, and you were then started on a new medication, lisinopril,
which you also tolerated well. You HCTZ was held and you should
stop taking this medication.
.
You should continue to take your medications as prescribed
below. You should call the office of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], your
cardiologist, to schedule an appointment in 2 weeks time.
.
If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath,
lightheadedness, or feelings of fainting, you should call your
doctor or return to the Emergency Room for evaluation.
.

Followup Instructions:
You should call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], your cardiologist, at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 920**]
