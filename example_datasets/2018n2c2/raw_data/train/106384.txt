History of Present Illness:
73 year old patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11493**] with a history of
rheumatic heart disease with moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], PAF (on
coumadin), hypertension who has a history of vague chest pain.
She was admitted to [**Location (un) **] back in [**Month (only) 359**] and ruled out.
Stress on [**2150-11-9**] exercised for 4 minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol
to a heart rate of 98.  She experienced no chest pain and had no
significant ST-T wave changes.  Nuclear images did show a
posterolateral reversible defect in addition to a small anterior
apical defect. She was seen last week by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] in the office
for evaluation of near syncope and given an event monitor. Today
she went to the [**Location (un) **] ER due to increasing chest pain over the
past week with associated weakness. No significant findings on
event monitor per [**Doctor Last Name 11493**]. Per patient, she has had symptoms of
left shoulder pain radiating down her left arm and up left jaw
for many years and all previous work-up has been negative.
However, in past month, she has developed a new type of chest
discomfort over entire chest and associated with nausea and
feeling fatigued and lightheaded. No palps, no SOB, no LOC, no
association with any activity. She has 4 episodes a day lasting
about 5 minutes. Nothing make it better or worse and they occur
irregardless of activity.
.
Upon arrival to [**Location (un) **] ER, INR 3.3. EKG without acute findings
of ischemia. She received SLNTG X3 with no effect. Nitro gtt
started and CP free after 30 min. Then, 45 min later developed
hypotension to 84/36, pt asymptomatic -> nitro gtt stopped, 500
of NS, then 1L NS bolus. SBP in mid80's and she was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On route to [**Hospital1 18**], SBP dropped again->500 cc NS given. SBP
dropped to 47/26 -> started dopamine 20 mcg in ambulance. BP
rose to 110-130s within 5 minutes. NO chest pain, palps, SOB
during this, but did feel more fatigued.
.
In CCU, afebrile, 111/64, 62, 100%2LNC. She reports feeling
fatigued, but no other symptoms of CP, palp, SOB, LHD,
dizzyness. At baseline, she can climb 2 flights of stairs and
now feels slightly more fatigued than usual.
.
ROS remarkable for intermittent right eye loss of vision "like
blind pulled down" for past month, occasional tingling and
numbess of right face for at least 6 years (prior to stroke).
+PND, sleeps with 2 pillows, no LE swelling, no pleuritic CP,
recent illnesses, bladder/bowel changes.

Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated sinus rhythm, 60bpm, nl axis, PR 200 msec, no

TELEMETRY demonstrated: normal rhythm,
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: Per patient, she had an echo 1 week prior
which was reportedly normal
ETT: Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] notes: [**2150-11-9**]. 4 minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
protocol to a heart rate of 98.  She experienced no chest pain
and had no significant ST-T wave changes.  Nuclear images did
show a posterolateral reversible defect in addition to a small
anterior apical defect.

CXR:  In comparison with the study of [**1-25**], the patient has
taken a
better inspiration.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal
limits with mild prominence of the ascending aorta that would
reflect aortic stenosis or hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 73 y/o F hx PAF on coumadin, HTN, bradycardia and
first degree AVB now presents with chest pressure and
lightheadedness

CAD: Patient has no known diagnosis of CAD, and cardiac cath
from [**2148**] from [**Hospital3 2568**] had clean coronary arteries.  She ruled
out for an MI here and had a stress stress P - MIBI which
revealed no perfusion defects and an LVEF of 65%. Recent stress
test per OSH cardiologist notes echo done last week per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] no valve abnormalites. Prior report of MS/MR incorrect.
She has been having these symptoms for the past month and her
cardiologist felt that there may be a component of near syncope
[**3-13**] bradycardia as opposed to CAD. However, her symptoms were
relieved with nitro. NO EKG changes. [**Hospital3 **] cath report from
[**2148**] show clean coronary arteries.  Given negative stress,
recent cath that was negative, reportedly normal echo a decision
was made not to cath the patient.  Beta blocker, aspirin, statin
were continued.  Her coumadin was held as an inpatient as she
was supratherapeutic, this drifted down to INR 1.5 upon
discharge, she was discharged with a lovenox bridge.  A1C 6.1%.
LDL 70, HDL 40, Total 131, Trig 107.

Chest Pain: 2 weeks at most 30 min at a time, no assoc w/
exerction, not reproduced w/ palpation dull in nature, several
times per day. Supratherapeutic on couadmin and not pleurtic
making PE less likely, no tenderness on exam so costochondritis
is less likely, cannot rule out coronary vasospasm.  Patient
should also have a workup for GERD as an outpatient.

Rhythm: Hx of paroxsysmal afib,  continue anticoagulation and
propafenone.  INR 1.4 on discharge, discharged with lovenox
bridge with close follow up with her primary cardiologist.

Hypotension: patient was hypotensive in the setting of nitro
gtt, transiently on a dopamine drip for a SBP in the 40s
although the patient was mentating at the time and there is a
question as to whether the pressure was actually as low as
recorded.  Hypotension did not return and the patient was
normotensive with the addition of her home antihypertensive
regimen.

Loss of vision/curtain like loss of vision in R eye on waking
for the past month.  temporal arteritis given ESR of 7 and
normal physical exam.  Normal carotids on exam, possibly TIA,
the patient should have carotid ultrasounds as an outpatient at
an early date if she has not already had them.  She is on
aspirin and anticoagulated.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for workup of chest pain, lightheadness. You
had a full workup of your heart which was negative for any
problems with your heart as the reason for your symptoms. This
was including a stress test that was negative for any
significant cardiac abnormalities.

While you were here, your coumadin level (INR) was found to be
low.  We have started you on a medication, Lovenox, to be
injected twice daily. This should be continued until your INR
becomes therapeutic at a level of [**3-14**]. You should follow up with
your primary care doctor this week for regular checks of your
INR to determine when you can stop this medication. Your first
lab check for this will be in 2 days from discharge on [**2151-1-29**]
where you should get your INR checked before your annual
physical exam with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27542**].

Please take all your medications as prescribed and keep all
follow up appointments. We made no changes to your medications
except the addition of the lovenox injections twice a day until
your INR is within the 2-3 range on your coumadin and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 27542**] gives the okay for you to stop the lovenox
injections.

If you develop chest pain, increased shortness of breath, severe
weakness or any other symptom that concerns you, please call
your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10836**] to the Emergency Room as soon as
