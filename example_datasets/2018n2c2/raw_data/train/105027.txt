History of Present Illness:
This is a 37 year old female who presented to OSH with 5 days of
LLQ/left flank pain. She was initially seen at [**Hospital3 **] on [**9-14**] and was diagnosed with a ruptured ovarian cyst
on TVUS; she was discharged on oxycodone-APAP. On [**9-15**] she
developed subjective fevers/rigors, increased pain, and
shortness of breath with exertion. Over the weekend her pain
became more diffuse, across the upper abdomen. She then
re-presented on [**9-18**] to [**Hospital6 33**], where workup
included a CT abdomen/pelvis with evidence of pyelonephritis.
She was given a dose of levofloxacin, IV hydromorphone, and a
undefinded amount of IVF. Her labs also showed platelets of 69K,
low WBC, and low hematocrit around 32 (substantially different
from normal values on [**9-14**]). No blood or urine cultures were
obtained. DIC labs were sent and revealed high fibrinogen, a
mildly elevated INR, smear with occasional schistocytes. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her initial vitals were: 100.4F, HR 124, BP
134/92, RR 18, Sat 99% (on room air). Repeat labs again
demonstrated platelets of 60K, stable hematocrit at 31, elevated
D-dimer, fibrinogen pending. Also apparently with new decrease
in renal function. Heme-onc was called and advised to wait on
anticoagulation; they would see the patient in the ICU.
Clinically, she looks well except for back pain, which has been
responding to hydromorphone. Vitals prior to transfer are:
145/90 100 18 98RA. In the ED she received 3L NS,
Piperacillin/Tazobactam 4.5 gm IV, vancomycin 1gm IV,
hydromorphone, and acetaminophen 1gm.

Review of systems: + chronic headaches with new frontal
headaches for four days. No vision or hearing change. No URI
symptoms. No N/V or diarrhea. No blood in stool. No
constipation. Mild urinary urgency on friday, no dysuria, or
hematuria. Mild ankle swelling s/p sprain. No weakness. "razor
burn on legs" Pt reports easy bruising.  H/o bleeding with TAH
requiring repeat operation for internal bleeding. No h/o of
bleeding with dental work. no history of clots.


Past Medical History:
-melanoma in situ excised 11 years prior to presentation, no
recurrence
-endometriosis
-migraines
-R radial nerve damage from compression
-s/p TAH/USO 8 yrs ago, c/b need for 3 units PRBC due to
bleeding at a ligation site
-chronic anemia


Social History:
She is currently unemployed. She smokes 1 PPD since a teenage,
and drinks socially. She is here alone, and denies any recent
travel or insect/tick bites.

Radiology AND OTHER STRATEGIES
===============================
ECG [**2125-9-18**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Poor R wave progression is probably a normal
variant.
Diffuse T wave changes that are non-specific. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

Chest Radiograph [**2125-9-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial edema. Small left effusion.

Ultrasound of Abdomen [**2125-9-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarged and heterogeneous left kidney, consistent with given
history of
pyelonephritis, with a number of hypoechoic areas in the upper
pole
potentially suspicious for abscess. No evidence of
hydronephrosis.
2. Nondistended gallbladder with gallbladder wall edema likely
secondary to
third spacing. No specific son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for
cholecystitis.
3. The CBD is dilated measuring 0.8 cm without intrahepatic bile
dilatation.
4. Patent portal vein.

CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/Contrast [**2125-9-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe acute left pyelonephritis with marked renal edema,
evolving foci of hypoperfusion, parenchymal necrosis,
inflammatory phlegmon or early abscess formation.
2. Multiple pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm in the left
lower lobe.
In the setting of infection, these could reflect septic emboli
or other
infectious processes. Followup chest CT to document resolution
is
recommended.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions and basilar consolidations could
reflect
atelectasis and/or superimposed pneumonia.
4. Gallbladder wall edema, pericholecystic fluid and
pericholecystic hepatic parenchymal hyperemia, unchanged from
prior ultrasound. While these findings are felt likely reactive
in the setting of other abnormalities (particularly since the
gallbladder does not appear distended), by imaging this is
equivocal for acute cholecystitis, and therefore if there is
clinical concern a HIDA scan may be considered.

MRI Abdomen W and W/O Contrast [**2125-9-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute infarction involving much of the upper pole and
interpolar region of the left kidney, coexistent pyelonephritis
is possible. Two small discrete regions of fluid signal
intensity may be explained by necrosis, although abscess
formation cannot be excluded.
2. Irregularity of bilateral renal arteries though confidence in
that finding is low due to motion and potential artifact -
fibromuscular dysplasia or vasculitis can have this appearance.
A repeat study of the renal arteries is suggested when the
patient is more stable.
3. Gallbladder wall edema is commonly seen with third spacing of
fluid.
Common bile duct dilated to 9 mm, but has normal distal smooth
tapering and
there is no evidence of cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis and/or
consolidation at the lung bases.

CT Chest W/O Contrast [**2125-9-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse ground-glass opacity primarily within the bilateral
upper lobes.
Differential diagnosis includes atypical infectious pneumonia,
such as PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 84655**] pneumonia and pulmonary edema/hemorrhage.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
3. Emphysematous changes.

TTE [**2125-9-24**]:
Conclusions
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium. A
patent foramen ovale is present. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-9-18**], a
patent foramen ovale is seen.

MRA Kidney W/ and W/O Contrast [**2125-9-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarged left kidney, with large, wedge-shaped areas of
liquefactive
necrosis at the upper pole and interpolar region. The areas of
involvement
are unchanged in size and appearance. While abscesses cannot be
completely
excluded, the presence of preserved capsular enhancement, and
the absence of extensive edema or perinephric inflammatory
changes is more consistent with multifocal infarct. Given the
clinical presentation, MR findings are most consistent with
multiple renal infarcts in the setting of pyelonephritis.
2. Normal renal vasculature, with no abnormalities of the renal
arteries to
suggest fibromuscular dysplasia or vasculitis. Widely patent
left renal vein without filling defect.
3. Moderate left and small right pleural effusions with
atelectasis.

Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasounds [**2125-9-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of DVT in the lower extremities.

CTA Chest W/ and W/O Contrast [**2125-9-26**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus. No aortic dissection.
2. Resolved right pleural effusion and persistent but now
slightly loculated moderate left pleural effusion with
associated atelectasis.
3. Decreased ground-glass opacification in the background of
persistent
emphysema.
4. Incompletely characterized right kidney abnormality

RUQ Ultrasound [**2125-9-28**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Non-distended gallbladder, with no pericholecystic fluid or
cholelithiasis. No specific son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for
cholecystitis.
2. Persistent dilatation of the common bile duct without
intrahepatic bile
duct dilatation. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for choledocholithiasis
within the
visualized common duct.

Chest Radiograph [**2125-10-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Small stable left pleural effusion, with no evidence
of
pneumothorax.

MRI Abdomen W/ and W/O Contrast [**2125-10-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No new areas of infarction within the left kidney compared to
multiple
prior studies. Areas of T2 signal hyperintensity within the
lateral
interpolar region and upper pole of the left kidney
corresponding to stable
areas of absent contrast enhancement in addition to striated
enhancement
within the left lower pole. These findings represent features of
both
pyelonephritis and infarction. Small vessel vasculitis should be
included in the differential.
2. Resolution of right pleural effusion with decrease in size of
small left
pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
37 year old female with acute onset thyrombocytopenia and sepsis
likely secondary to renal infarction and pyelonephritis.

1) SIRS/Sepsis: Patient initially presented with left flank
pain, tachycardia, low WBC, and low platelets. Based on OSH
non-contrast CT scan it appeared this was consistent with
pyelonephritis. She was started on cefepime, flagyl and
vancomycin [**9-19**]. With concern for worsening abdominal pain a
repeat contrast abdominal and pelvic CT was performed. It showed
severe acute left pyelonephritis with marked renal edema and
evolving foci of hypoperfusion, parenchymal necrosis,
inflammatory phlegmon or early abscess formation.  Urology was
consulted given concern for a need for acute surgical
management.  They suggested a concern for renal vein/artery
thrombosis due to the appearance of multifocal necrosis in the
kidney.  MRI revealed no acute thrombosis but was suggestive of
an acute infarction involving much of the upper pole and
interpolar region of the left kidney without being able to rule
out coexistent pyelonephritis.  The patient's white count
eventually trended up from a nadir of 2.5 to the 9's and she was
transitioned from cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole to
oral ciprofloxacin.  All cultures remained negative but she did
complete a fourteen day course of antibiotics for a suspected
pyelonephritis.  Vasculitis was also considered as an etiology
for her SIRS but no clear evidence for a particular syndrome was
found.  Her blood pressures stabilized and she was completely
hemodynamically stable for > 1 wk prior to discharge.  She did
remain febrile despite negative cultures, which was thought most
likely due to inflammation secondary to her necrotic kidney.
Prior to discharge her fever curve had been trending down and
she did not become more febrile after antibiotics were stopped.
Cultures similarly remained negative.  Repeat MRI of kidney was
obtained to look for an abscess or closed space infection and
was negative.

2) Left renal infarcts: Given patient's family history of factor
V leiden mutation there was some concern that she could have a
thrombophilia predisposing her to clot. Agitated saline TTE
revealed a PFO, which raised concern for paradoxical
embolization but work up for VTE was unremarkable.  Severe
pyelonephritis could also cause renal infarction but as reported
above cultures never impressively reenforced a pyelonephritis.
Similarly septic emboli were thought extremely unlikely given
persistently negative blood cultures.  Investigation for factor
V leiden mutation was negative and no clear reason for
hypercoagulability was found.  The patient was nevertheless
anticoagulated as the benefits of anticoagulation were felt to
outweigh the risks.  Therefore, she was started on coumadin and
discharged on this as well as enoxaparin for bridge as she was
not yet therapeutic.  Renal function remained essentially stable
after the patient was hydrated on her day of presentation.  The
patient will follow up in hematology for further
hypercoagulability work-up.

3) Thrombocytopenia:  The patient was transferred partially due
to concern for DIC or TTP due to her thrombocytopenia.
Hematology/Oncology was consulted and thought  low platelets
were not consistent with DIC or TTP and she did not have
diagnostic numbers of schistocytes or a low fibrinogen.  Most
likely etiology of her thrombocytopenia was thought to be marrow
suppression secondary to SIRS/sepsis.  Ultimately her platelet
count recovered and was normal at the time of discharge.  She
did receive one unit of platelets during an IJ placement.

4)Pulmonary edema/Pleural effusions: Initial CXR showed
pulmonary edema with a small pleural effusion. A BNP was 6587.
An echocardiogram was performed with concern for cardiovascular
compromise and it showed a normal ejection fraction, normal wall
motion, and 1+MR. It was felt the patient's pulmonary edema and
effusions were secondary to fluid resuscitation.  She had one
episode of desaturation to 88% when she laid flat in her CT
scan. She intermittently required 2 Liters NC for comfort. Her
difficulty breathing was felt to be due to her abdominal pain
causing pain upon deep inspiration and fluid overload. Her pain
was controlled and patient was auto-diuresing >150cc/hr upon
transfer to the floor. She continued to auto-diurese on the
floor and eventually came off of oxygen entirely.  Better pain
control significantly improved her respiratory function and
prior to discharge her pulmonary exam was normal and she was
ambulating without desaturations.  CT showed a persistent,
loculated pleural effusion, and given persistent fevers, a
thoracentesis was attempted but as the effusion was steadily
decreasing in size interventional pulmonology and interventional
radiology thought it was too small to drain safely.  As it
continued to decrease in size and the patient WBC count and
fevers were down trending this was not pursued further.

5) Abdominal pain: This was initially controlled with morphine
and morphine SR.  She appeared to be very drowsy and her RR
decreased on this regimen, so the ms contin was discontinued.
She continued to have significant pain, so a morphine PCA,
maximum dose of 4 mg/hr, that was started and the patient's pain
improved significantly. It was assessed that her pain was
consistent with post-embolization syndrome, which includes
fever, abdominal pain secondary to the clearance process of
necrotic tissue.  Eventually she was reestablished on a regimen
of morphine SR, morphine IR, and gabapentin with good
improvement in her pain.  She will likely need these for the
next few months as her body clears necrotic tissue from her
kidney.

6) Persistent sinus tachycardia: The patient informs us that she
has exhibited fast heart rates for years.  The patient did not
appear volume down as her CVP remained high. It was felt that
the tachycardia was due to pain, fever and the overall stress
response of sepsis. The tachycardia improved to the low 100s
after the administration of the PCA and remained there through
the day of discharge.

7) GERD: PPI held in setting of decreased plts. Ranitidine [**Hospital1 **]
started and then discontinued when platelet count recovered as
it was thought this was no longer indicated.

The patient had a PICC for IV access that was discontinued prior
to discharge.  She was tolerating a full diet prior to
discharge.  She was full code.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with back pain and were found
to have had injuries due to poor blood flow to parts of your
kidney.  It is unclear exactly why this occurred but we suspect
you may have some predisposition toward forming blood clots.
Therefore, you have been started on blood thinners to prevent
futher such events.  You have been started on coumadin as a long
term blood thinner, you are being discharged on enoxaparin, a
blood thinner, while we await your coumadin level to be
therapeutic.  You will need to see a hematologist as an
outpatient to complete your clotting disorder workup.

You had fevers in the hospital.  Because of the imaging findings
in your kidney we could not rule out a kidney infection.
Therefore, you received 14 days of therapy for a presumed kidney
infection.  You completed this prior to discharge.  Your
continued fevers and pain are likely due to an inflammatory
reaction as your body breaks down the portions of kidney tissue
that died.  You can take acetaminophen for these fevers as
needed.  Unfortunately, this inflammatory reaction also causes
pain, which we have treated with multiple pain medicines.

You will need follow up with a primary care provider and
coumadin clinic to follow how thin your blood is.  You will also
need follow up with a kidney doctor to follow your kidney
function, a hematologist to assess you for a predisposition to
clotting and help manage this, and a rheumatologist as some of
your tests suggest a possible autoimmune disorder.  We have
scheduled these appointments for you.

Your medications have been changed.  You have been started on
coumadin, a blood thinner, that you will need to take until your
are told to stop by a doctor.  Your blood has not yet been
thinned enough by coumadin so you are also being discharged on
ENOXAPARIN(LOVENOX), which will keep your blood thin until your
coumadin levels are adequate.  When your coumadin levels are
adequate for 24 hours you can stop the enoxaparin.  You have
also been started on MORPHINE sustained release and immediate
release for pain.  You should not drive while using these
medications as they can make you sleepy.  You were also started
on GABAPENTIN (NEURONTIN) to help manage your pain.

Please seek immediate medical attention if you experience chest
pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or any change from
your baseline health status
