Service:

This is an addendum to the previous discharge summary
dictated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  This discharge summary
pertains to her last day of hospitalization.

On [**2129-3-20**], the patient's Coumadin was held, and the patient
was started on Heparin in preparation for an endoscopy to
further evaluate her anemia.  Per report, the endoscopy did
not discover any etiology for her guaiac-positive stools or
anemia.  The patient became very insistent on leaving after
having endoscopy, which did not further elucidate the anemia.
After discussion, the team decided to discharge the patient
home with VNA earlier than expected.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. Coronary artery disease status post three-vessel coronary
artery bypass graft.
3. Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter.
4. Gastrointestinal bleed.

difficulty.  Eating a full diet.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient is to followup at [**Hospital1 2057**]

communicated to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1313**], her cardiologist at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2058**].  In addition, she is to followup with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 1313**] on [**4-25**] for followup of her ischemic
cardiomyopathy.  She was advised that she should actually
schedule an appointment earlier than this [**4-25**]
appointment within the next week for more prompt followup
given her recent hospitalization.  She was also advised that
she needs to call to setup an appointment with her Infectious
Disease doctor, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2059**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 496**] for an
appointment one week within discharge.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2059**] was
