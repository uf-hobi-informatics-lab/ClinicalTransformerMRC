Chief Complaint:
Stridor

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2110-8-7**] Rigid bronchoscopy and ballon dilation

History of Present Illness:
34 year old female with asthma, GERD, post nasal drip, seizure
disorder and a history of congenital right lung hypoplasia [**1-30**]
tracheal-bronchial atresia and subglottic stenosis with history
of recurrent pneumonia, s/p tracheostomy in [**2100**], s/p
unsuccessful intrabronchial stent placement in [**2101-12-29**].
She has been lost to follow up with us since [**2101**]. In the mean
time she was being seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 12517**] [**Name (STitle) 16991**] at the Mass eye and
ENT infirmary. Since [**2101**] she had three tracheostomy tube
changed with laser ablation of the subglottic lesion. She had
the tracheostomy tube removed between [**2104**] and [**2105**] and has also
weaned off the oxygen.

Over the last three months she has been progressively more short
of breath with worsening stridor. She has had three pneumonia
over the last year, never needing admission to hospital. Treated
with Solu-Medrol and antibiotics including a antifungal. She has
also developed increasing DOE- she could climb one flight of
stairs, now she has to go very slow. The voice is more horse,
and noisy. She finds herself tired and fatigued. Cough is
productive of brown phlegm.

She underwent a scheduled rigid brochoscopy with balloon
dilation to her tracheal stenosis. Subsequently, she had
difficulty after extubation in the PACU. She develop stridor and
became agitated. She appear hypoxic and she was re-intubated,
which was proven to be difficult. She transciently became
bradycardic for <30 seconds, which improved with bag-mouth
ventalation. She recieved dexamethasone 5mg x 1 dose post-op.
Bronchoscopy was performed after re-intubation and no obvious
source of stridor was found. She is now being transfer to the
TSICU for further management.

CXR [**2110-8-7**]: AP single view of the chest was obtained with
patient in
semi-upright position.  The patient is intubated, the ETT is
seen to terminate in the trachea, 5 cm above the level of the
carina.  No pneumothorax or any other placement-related
complication can be identified.  An NG tube has been assed and
reaches well below the diaphragm including its side port.
External instruments and lines are overlying the right apical
area, but there is no evidence of any new pulmonary parenchymal
infiltrate anywhere in the lungs, and the lateral pleural
sinuses are free.  Skeletal structures grossly within normal
limits on this single view AP chest examination.  The next
preceding chest examination of this patient in our records is
dated [**2102-1-10**] and did not show any acute pulmonary
abnormalities.

CXR [**2110-8-10**]
FINDINGS:  The right IJ line has been removed.  There is no
focal infiltrate.
There is blunting of the right CP angle, consistent with small
effusion.
There is a linear lucency under the left hemidiaphragm that does
not conform
to the expected position of the stomach and is unclear if this
represents free
air.  This finding was called to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13651**] at 4:20 p.m. on
[**2110-8-10**] after
noticing this finding at 4:18 p.m.  Recommend clinical
correlation and
followup x-ray.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3924**] is a 34 yo F w/ extensive PMH included right lung
hypoplasia and multiple tracheostomy tubes with subsequent
tracheomalacia and subglotic stenosis who presented for an
outpatient elective rigid bronchoscopy with ballon dilation that
was complicated on extubation by likely laryngospasm with
stridor and reintubation who was reextubated successfully.

#Tracheo-bronchial atresia and Laryngospasm- patient had
striodor and respiratory distress following extubation from the
balloon dilation. A flexible bronchoscopy done in the PACU
showed some subglottic edema and the stenosis was patent.  She
was reintubated and admitted to the ICU.  There she received a
RIJ central line for access and ENT was consulted who performed
a fiberopstic evaluation where they did not see any evidence of
stenosis and it was felt to be most consistent with
laryngospasm.  She was treated with 24 hours of decadron and
then successfully extubated.  She was monitored by IP and will
require follow-up with them in the future to reassess her
hoarseness.

#Gastroesophageal reflux-stable
-continued on home omeprazole

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 3924**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were here at
[**Hospital1 18**].  You were admitted to the hospital after you had a
procedure to open up your trachea and you had some difficulty
breathing after the procedure. The breathing tube was placed
back in your throat and you were admitted to the ICU for a
couple of days and had the breathing tube removed. It is felt
that the problem breathing was likely due to a spasm of the
muscles in your throat.  You are now safe to go home.

We made the following changes to your medications:
Prednisone 60mg on [**9-28**], 40mg on [**9-21**], 20mg on [**7-20**], 10mg on [**7-17**]
Bactrim 1 tablet daily

Followup Instructions:
Your pulmonologist will call you for a follow up appointment in
3 to 4 weeks.
