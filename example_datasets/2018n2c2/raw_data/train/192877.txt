History of Present Illness:
79 yo woman with history of a-fib, CHF s/p bioprosthetic mitral
and s/p tricuspid valve annuloplasty, who initially was admitted
to [**11-4**] after she presented to ED with persistent bleeding
following L tooth extractions and posterior superior palate I
and D. Patient initially had INR elevated to 2.1 secondary to
warfarin use for atrial fibrillation. In ED ENT was consulted
and pt was packed to help control bleeding. Her INR was reversed
with vitamin K, 2 units FFP and her INR now is 1.1. She was
hypotensive with SBP in 80's on admission and was admitted to
the ICU. Hct was 21 on admission (baseline 30) and the patient
required 3 units of PRBCs on [**11-4**]. Her Hct has been stable at
28-29 x more than 24 hours and she was called out from the ICU
today.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2123-11-4**] 2:39 AM
FINDINGS: There is stable cardiomegaly. Elevation of right
hemidiaphragm persists. There is chronic pleural thickening on
the right, with right basilar atelectasis and small pleural
effusion present. There are no consolidations. Pulmonary
vascularity is normal.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of congestive heart
failure. Right chronic pleural thickening. Small right-sided
pleural effusion, probably unchanged. Right basilar atelectasis.
.
EKG- HR 86 Probable atrial fibrillation with multifocal PVCs or
aberrant ventricular
conduction
Right axis deviation
Right bundle branch block
Low QRS voltages in limb leads
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2123-11-14**] 1:56 PM
Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. Pneumonia
is not excluded.
Cardiomegaly, unchanged.
Mild kyphotic angulation at a mid thoracic level. Finding may be
better assessed with dedicated thoracic spine radiographs, if
clinically indicated. No fracture is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo female with h/o a Atrial Fibrillation, s/p bioprosthetic
mitral valve replacement, admitted with post-op bleeding
following dental extraction and palate I and D two days prior to
the admission in the setting of being anticoagulated (INR in
therapeutic range).
.
# Bleeding: Post-op due to anticoagulation with warfarin use for
atrial fibrillation. Bleeding started on [**11-2**], increased [**11-3**]
in ED packed and pressure applied. INR 2.7, and hematocrit 27,
SBP in the 80's to 90's.  Hematocrit lowest at 21 on admission.
Bleeding from posterior palate Incision and drainage site.
Bleeding resolved with no events in the ICU. HD stable. Last
transfusion on [**2123-11-4**]. Received 2 units of FFP, one unit of
PRBC, fluid boluses and vitamin K. To medicine floor at
Hematocrit stable [**11-6**], but that night encountered bleeding
from I&D site, Afrin spray applied and pressure with resolution,
no PRBC's given, hematocrit 27.7. No further bleeding during
course of admission. Coumadin restarted [**11-10**] as per instruction
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. 3 mg initial dose, given risk for
stroke in patient with A-fibb. As per wishes of patient and
family, patient remained in house until incision site appeared
healed, INR increased and no evidence of bleed. Discharged with
follow-up by cardiology and her oral surgeon. Clindamycin 450 PO
Q6 for abscess stopped after IV then PO course for 10 days.
Coumadin increased to 5 mg on discharge.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Rate control with beta-blocker. Continue
Statin/ beta-blocker. Held Coumadin until [**11-10**] when restarted
given decreasing concern of rebleed. In discussion with Dr.
[**Name (NI) **], pt's Cardiologist in regards to anticoagulation.
.
# CHF: EF >65% in 1/[**2123**]. Continued beta-blocker. Restarted
[**Year (4 digits) 11573**] per outpatient dose 4 days into admission. Had been held
in MICU given hypotension. Fluids also given. Held Aldactone
during admission given elevated potassium and hypotension. With
increasing work of breathing 3 days prior to discharge, evidence
of increasing overload on CXR, [**Year (4 digits) 11573**] given. Pt stable on 40 PO
[**Year (4 digits) 11573**] and resuming 25 Aldacton [**Hospital1 **] at discharge with follow-up
in the heart failure clinic.
.
# Hypotension: likely secondary to hypovolemia. Fluids given on
admission. Stopped as evidence of overload. Baseline low normal.
.
# CRI: Creatinine slowly trending up. Baseline ranging from
1.9-3.0. Stable as baseline at discharge. Continued renal diet

.
# FEN: Soft diet given abscess site tenuous for rebleed.
