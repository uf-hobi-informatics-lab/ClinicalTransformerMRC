Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-5-2**]
1. Redo sternotomy.
2. Redo coronary artery bypass grafting x1 with a reverse
    saphenous vein graft from the aorta to the previously
    placed double sequential vein graft to the posterior
descending coronary artery and second obtuse marginal coronary
artery
3. Aortic valve replacement with a 25-mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna Ease
    aortic valve bioprosthesis model number 3300TFX, serial
    number [**Serial Number 69062**].
4. Endoscopic vein harvesting.


History of Present Illness:
66yo male s/p CABG in [**2137-9-15**]. He
had known aortic stenosis at time of surgical revascularization
but it was not significant enough to require
aortic valve replacement. However since that time,  serial
echocardiograms have confirmed progression of aortic valve
stenosis. Currently he denies chest pain, dyspnea, syncope,
presyncope, palpitations, orthopnea, PND and pedal edema. He has
been referred for surgical evaluation.

- Hypothyroid related to amiodarone
Past Surgical History

Pertinent Results:
[**2142-5-2**], Intraop TEE
Conclusions
Pre CPB (before first bypass run):
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left
ventricular diastolic function.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**12-17**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
Wire was seen in descending aorta during femoral artery
cannulation.
Femoral venous cannula seen entering SVC during placement by
surgeon.

Post CPB:
The patient is being A-paced on phenylephrine and epinephrine
infusions.
The is a well seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position
which has mean/peak gradients of 7/16mmHg with a cardiac output
of 6/1L/minute.
There is trivial mitral regurgitation.
The visible contours of the thoracic aorta are intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2142-5-2**] where
the patient underwent redo, AVR (tissue), revision of PDA/OM
graft .   Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  He
developed urinary retention.  Foley was re-inserted and Flomax
started, he voided following 2nd foley removal.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.

The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing
and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged to home with Partners [**Name (NI) 269**] in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
