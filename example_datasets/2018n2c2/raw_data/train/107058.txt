History of Present Illness:
69 year-old man with a h/o DM2, CAD, CHF, GERD, chronic

uvular swelling.  Pt reports that he was walking to the bathroom
at midnight when he noted the onset of a swelling sensation in
his throat with difficulty and mild pain on swallowing.  He also
notes mild lip swelling.  No urticaria, flushing, pruritis, or
lightheadedness.  No fevers, cough, swollen lymph nodes, sore
throat, or purulent sputum.  He has stable rhinorrhea worst at
night from chronic sinusitis.  He denies any difficulty handling
his secretions or dysphagia; these sx are dissimilar from those
leading to his esophageal dilatation several years ago.  The
patient does recall one similar prior episode a few years ago
after eating a [**Location (un) 6002**].  At an OSH ED, he was given some
medications and the swelling resolved after several hours; this
was attributed to mayonnaise. He has tolerated this fine since
and denies mayonnaise or other new foods recently.  He reports
being on lisinopril for 2-3 years; he believes he was taking it
at the time of this previous episode. His only new medication is
ferrous sulfate, started yesterday AM.  He has not taken ASA or
NSAIDs in at least 4 months due to his renal failure.  No insect
stings or chemical exposures.  No chronic abdominal pain or
family history of angioedema.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo man with DM, CAD, GERD, chronic sinusitis, asthma, s/p
esophageal dilatation p/w angioedema.
.
# Angioedema: C/w angioedema.  Most commonly associated with
ACE-I.  Does have a history of similar episode; acquired C1
inhibitor deficiency possible - familial less likely given age
and absence of family hx.  Did just start iron supplement and
allergy to a component is possible, but time course not as
consistent and more likely kinin-mediated rather than mast cell
given absence of urticaria, prurutis.  No inhalant abuse; not
taking ASA or NSAIDS due to renal failure. Pharyngitis can cause
uvular swelling but no fever, exudates, or sore throat to
suggest acute infectious etiology.  Lisinopril was held on
admission and the patient was instructed not to resume this
medication.  Complement levels were checked.  His angioedema
resolved completely by the end of the day and he was discharged.
.
# HTN: He was restarted on home blood pressure medications
except for lisinopril.  Blood pressure was controlled and he was
discharged with instructions to f/u with his PCP.
.
# DM: He reports episodes of hypoglycemia at home in the 50s and
Lantus was recently lowered.  His Glyburide was stopped on
admission due to his end stage renal disease.  He will continue
to monitor his blood sugars regularly at home.
.
# ESRD: In work-up for PD and transplant. Sevelamer and
calcitriol continued.
.
# CAD: Stable: Simvastatin and b-blocker continued.
.
# CHF: Euvolemic: Home lasix dose continued.
.
.
# Prostate cancer: New dx, [**Doctor Last Name **] score 6
