unexpected following recent G-tube placement. Cardiomediastinal
contours are unchanged. The lungs are grossly clear and well
expanded. Right PICC terminates in the mid SVC. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

less. _____
tube is again seen over the left upper quadrant. There is patchy
atelectasis in the left lower lung. The right subclavian PICC
