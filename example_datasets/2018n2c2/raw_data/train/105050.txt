HISTORY: Sudden onset of severe headache.

Comparison is made with [**2124-11-1**].

There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute transcortical
infarction.
The ventricles and sulci are unchanged in size and
configuration. No bony
lesions are seen.

Impression: No evidence for mass or acute [**Month/Day/Year **]
.
MRA CHEST

CLINICAL INDICATION: A 45-year-old man with end-stage renal
disease on
hemodialysis, DM1, hypertension, and heart failure with severe
hypertension,
chest pain. Rule out aortic dissection.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted MR images were
acquired on a 1.5
Tesla magnet without the administration of intravenous
gadolinium.

COMPARISON EXAM: Chest radiograph on [**2125-2-5**].

FINDINGS:

Central vein catheter in place with tip in SVC.
The aorta is of normal caliber with no evidence of dissection,
intramural
hematoma, or atherosclerotic ulcer. No intraluminal filling
defects are seen.
The aorta measures 2.8 x 2.7 cm at the ascending portion, 2.5 cm
at the arch,
and 1.9 x 1.8 cm at the descending portion. The main pulmonary
artery is
enlarged and measures maximally to 3.0 cm.

There is cardiomegaly with enlargement of all four [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].
Heart otherwise shows no gross abnormalities. No pericardial
effusion. No pleural effusions are evident. Decrease in size of
mediastinal lymphadenopathy that was seen on prior CT.
Mediastinal vasculature is otherwise unremarkable.

No abnormal marrow signal is evident. Soft tissues show no
abnormalities.
Pleural surfaces are clear. Visualized portions of the upper
abdomen show no abnormalities.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of aortic dissection or acute aortic
abnormalities.

2. Cardiomegaly.

3. Enlarged main pulmonary artery which may be related to
pulmonary
hypertension, of which no causes are identified on this study.
.
STUDY: CT of the head without contrast.

HISTORY: A 45-year-old male with elevated blood pressure,
headache, and
vomiting. Assess for head [**Doctor Last Name **].

COMPARISONS: [**2125-2-5**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast MDCT images of the head were obtained
and displayed
in 5-mm axial reconstructions.

FINDINGS: This study is mildly degraded by patient motion. There
is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline
structures,
hydrocephalus,or obvious large vascular territorial infarction.
Cavum septum pellucidum et vergae is noted and unchanged. The
density values of the brain parenchyma are maintained. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well
aerated. The soft tissues and osseous structures are
unremarkable.

Moderate calcification involving the cavernous portions of the
carotid
arteries and the vertebral arteries, left greater than right,
are evident
bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
EXAMINATION: Brain MRI.

HISTORY: 45-year-old male presents with severe headache.

COMPARISON: Head CTs [**2121-12-6**] through [**2125-2-6**].

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, axial T2 FSE, T2, GRE, FLAIR, diffusion,
3D
time-of-flight MRA sequences through the brain were obtained.

FINDINGS: There are scattered periventricular and T2
hyperintensities within the bihemispheric white matter. There is
extensive T2 signal abnormality throughout the pons. There is no
acute infarct. Incidental note is made of a cavum septum
pellucidum and vergae.

MRA: The intracranial internal carotid arteries are normal, as
are the middle and anterior cerebral arteries. The posterior
circulation is normal. Minimal flow signal within the proximal
V3 segment of the left vertebral artery is likely artifactual.

IMPRESSION:
1. Scattered T2 hyperintensities throughout the bihemispheric
white matter
and more extensive confluent changes throughout the pons may be
secondary to severe microvascular ischemic disease in this
patient with a history of
chronic type 1 diabetes, end-stage renal disease on [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] and
poorly
controlled hypertension.

2. No intracranial hemorrhage, vascular malformation or other
acute
abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 yo male h/o DMT1, ESRD, on HD, presenting with hypertensive
urgency/emergency in setting of worst headache of his life.

# Headache: Given history the concern was for intracranial [**Doctor Last Name **]
initially. Head CT was without bleeding, and Head MRI/MRA/MRV
was without bleeding or vascular malformation or venous
thrombosis. Patient initially refused LP. Since his headache
persisted for four days without resolution and reported left eye
blurriness, and left eye pain. Neurology was consulted and they
thought the pain may be from a migraine or a vascular phenomenon
and less likely intracranial [**Doctor Last Name **]. They recommended an LP to
rule out [**Doctor Last Name **] or infection given his vague symptoms. Fioricet
was started to treat his headache. On day 5 of his
hospitalziation, his headache resolved, however 24 hours later
his headache returned during [**Doctor Last Name 2286**]. Given the non-specific
headache, an LP was performed after patient ultimately
consented. First attempt at bedside was unsuccessful. He
eventually underwent an LP under fluoroscopic guidance at
interventional radiology with CSF only notable for a mildy
elevated opening pressure of 27 cm H2O. He notably had only 1
wbc, 0 rbcs, and negative culture, Cryptoccocal Ag, EBV and HSV
viral PCRs.

 The headache persistently had an unclear etiology. The leading
differential was vasospasm vs. migraine vs. HTN vs. ?HD related
(since it was more prominent on HD days). It was decided to
discontinue his nifedipine and start verapamil, as verapamil is
more vasoactive; this medication would help vasospasm, migraine,
and HTN etiology.  His headaches persisted despite these
interventions. Pain was consulted and felt that dilaudid may be
helpful. It was felt that an injection would not be helpful,
given the diffuse nature of his headaches. Fioricet was
discontinued, as it did not appear to be effective any more. He
was continued on full dose verapamil and dilaudid prn. His HTN
medication was aggressively uptitrated with the thought this
this would help his headaches. This moderately controlled his
headaches. He also had severe nausea and vomiting that was
controlled with reglan, compazine, and zofran, which was also
thought to help his headaches. He was given a trial of high flow
oxygen as well in case the etiology was cluster headache, but
this was not successful.

 Of note, the patient was felt to be quite sensitive to opiates
and benzos. On the day of his IR guided LP, he received 1 mg of
IV Ativan, which decreased his RR to 8 and he appeared very
sleepy. He also received 4 mg IV morphine to help control his
HA, but he also developed decreased RR to 8 and the same
sleepiness. He was not given these medications any more.

 Since the etiology of his headache was unclear, it was felt
that placing the patient on a regimen that he could take at home
would be the best for him, rather than IV dilaudid. Pain was
re-consulted. He was started on low dose MS-contin [**Hospital1 **] and 25 mg
topomax [**Hospital1 **]. Approximately 36 hours after these medications were
started the patient was completely somnolent and responsive to
sternal rub only. He was given Narcan 0.4 mg approximately three
times over the course of his somnolence and woke up briefly. He
remained in this state for nearly 72 hours. It was felt the
patient was on too much sedating medication causing this
deleterious effect. All opiates, topomax, and gabapentin were
all d/c'd. He was given an extra day of HD in hopes that this
would clear some of the medication that has built up in his
system. He remained hemodynamically stable and protected his
airway. These medications should be re-started only if
absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. He was not given
any more sedating medication and only given standing tylenol,
1000 mg q 8H. Surprisingly, tylenol by itself appeared to
control his headaches in the days leading up to discharge. He
was headache free in the last 24 hours of his admission.

It is truly unclear what the cause of his headaches are. It is
still speculated that HD may be the cause, as small studies have
demonstrated HD may cause headaches. It is unclear what the
treatment for this is. Also, HTN headaches did not show a clear
pattern, it is striking how when his blood pressure is ideally
controlled, his headaches have cleared. Nevertheless, his
headaches have resolved for the time being and further follow-up
with his PCP is in order.

# Hypertension: His hypertension was most pronounced on
hemodialysis days with SBPs in the 200s frequently.  As a
result, his antihypertensive regimen was aggressively increased.
 He began to take all of his anti-hypertensives everyday of the
week, including on HD days. He continued to have very high blood
pressures after this regimen. His BP medications were increased
to maximal doses. A clonidine patch was added at 0.1 mg q
weekly. He continued to have episodes of sbp to the 200s
occuring after [**Hospital1 2286**] in the setting of a severe headache. He
was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring. His MICU
course was uneventful as his blood pressure decreased with IV
hydralazine x 1 and po labetalol, along with taking his BP
medications. He did not need an IV drip for blood pressure. He
was then started on Minoxidil 10 mg po BID. Near the end of his
hospitalization, his blood pressure was lower than expected with
levels in the low 100s. Minoxidil was decreased to 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]. It
was also noted that he was not wearing his clonidine patch for
several days in the setting of well controlled blood pressures.
After consultation with renal on the day of discharge, his
current regimen is as follows:
--Lisinopril 80 mg po daily (To be held the mornings prior to
HD)
--Valsartan 320 mg qhs
--Carvedilol 25 mg po BID
--Minoxidil 5 mg po BID (To be held the mornings prior to HD)
---Close follow up with his bp is highly recommended.

# Nausea/Vomiting: This was initially thought to be due to
gastroparesis, but a GES was performed which showed normal
motility. His N/V were felt to be secondary to his severe
headaches. His metoclopramide was continued, as was compazine
and zofran.   At times, despite these medications, he continued
to have nausea and vomiting. This proved quite difficult to
manage his blood pressure, as he would vomit his medication.
Once this was controlled, his blood pressure and headaches, and
eventually his nausea and vomiting improved. He was discharged
on metoclopramide 5 mg PO TID. Further evaluation of this
standing medication should be evaluated by his PCP at his next
visit.

# Cranial Nerve III Palsy: Diplopia was initially reported on
[**2-11**].  On further questioning the patient reports his symptoms
began on [**2-7**] after the ophtho exam.  Neuro initially evaluated
and feels likely third nerve palsy from diabetes.  LP negative
besides increased ICP of 27 mm Hg. Optho re-consulted [**2-18**] and
confirmed complete CN3 palsy as the cause of diplopia and
complete ptosis of left eye. It was felt that this may be
reversible, but if not, it can be surgically corrected. He will
follow up with Neuro-optho in the outpatient.

# DM1: continued home 75/25 plus HISS. He was given half his
standing dose when not tolerating PO.

# CKD: continued HD. Pt continued on sevelamer alone (phoslo
discontinued).

# Neuropathy: gabapentin was increased to TID initially, but
when patient became somnolent for several days, this medication
was discontinued. Of note, he was on a very high dose for HD
patients (300 mg TID). It was felt this may have contributed to
his somnolence. Caution should be made in the future if this
medication were to be re-started. He was continued on a
lidocaine patch for chronic left flank pain.

# Depression: During an episode of severe pain, the patient
stated he wanted to "kill himself." Since he has a history of
suicidal attempts, a 1:1 sitter was attempted. Through the
course of the day, growing concern that he would act on his
ideations by the sitter. Psychiatry was consulted and felt he
was not suicidal at this time, and the sitter was discontinued.
He was continued on citalopram. Social work actively consulted
the patient and helped him deal with his many social problems.
[**Name (NI) **] is to be followed with psychiatry in rehab.

# Low grade fever: A fever of 100.5 was noted during his
hospitalization. He was pan-cultured which was NGTD at time of
discharge. A chest x-ray did not show any acute finding. He was
not given antibiotics and his fevers resolved.

# Access: He had a right central line during this
hospitalization which was pulled prior to discharge. He has a
left AV fisula used for HD.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for headache and elevated blood
pressures. We were concerned that your headache might be from a
[**Hospital1 **] in your head but the ct scan of your head did not show any
bleeding. We asked for your permission to look at your
cerebrospinal fluid to confirm that you did not have a [**Hospital1 **] in
your head, but you initially refused. We told you that if we
miss [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] in your head that could result in another larger
head [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] later, possibly even deadly, and you said you
understood this risk. We did check an MRI of your head to see if
we could see any blood vesels likely to [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and that showed
did not show a source of bleeding. Your headaches eventually
resolved after addition of fioricet, but then then returned in
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2286**].  A lumbar puncture was eventually performed by
interventional radiology and your CSF fluid was negative for
bleeding or infection.  Your nifedipine was also discontinued
and switched to verapimil to help your headache. Your headache
continued to persist. The pain service was consulted and a very
strong medication, Dilaudid was suggested. We stopped your
fiorcet as this did not appear to help your pain anymore, and
gave you dilaudid for your pain. This helped your headaches
mildly. We tried to change your pain medication to different
drugs (ms contin and low dose topomax), but this made you very
sleepy for several days. We stopped all of these medications
plus all strong sedating medications, such as dilaudid,
gabapentin, and ambien. You were continued on tylenol alone for
pain control, and surprisingly, this alleviated your headaches.
You are advised to not take these sedating medications any more
as it is very difficult for your body and kidneys to process
these medications. On the day of discharge, you were headache
free.

Your blood pressure was also very high during this hospital
stay. It appeared to be quite higher on your hemodialysis days.
We continued all of your medications on your [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2286**] days. We
also increased the dosage of several of your medications as well
as added new medications that are listed below. During your
hospital stay, you were briefly transferred to the intensive
care unit for closer evaluation of your elevated blood pressure.
You were monitored closely and your blood pressures decreased.
You were transferred back to the general floor. More blood
pressure medications were added and your blood pressure became
ideally controlled. Your new regimen is below.

You also developed double vision which we feel is secondary to a
nerve in your eye that is not working correctly caused by your
diabetes. This may reverse, but you may need surgery in the
future to correct this. You will be followed up by
Neuro-opthomology for further evaluation of this.

When you came in you also had chest pain, but we do not think
you had a heart attack.

You also had significant nausea and vomiting during your
hospital stay. We gave you strong medications to help this. You
eventually were able to tolerate food and medications. You will
be discharged on a home dose of an anti-nausea medication,
reglan.

When you go back to rehab, your new medications are as follows:

YOUR NEW BLOOD PRESSURE REGIMEN:
Verapamil 240 mg every 12 hours
Valsartan 320 mg every night
Lisinopril 80 mg daily
Minoxidil 5 mg twice a day
Clonidine patch 0.1 mg to be applied every saturday (keep on all
week)

PAIN CONTROL:
Lidocaine 5% patch, apply 12 hours on and 12 hours off as needed
for flank pain
Tylenol 1000 mg every eight hours for headache. Do not take more
than 4 grams of tylenol in 24 hours

STOP: Gabapentin (this may make you sleepy)
      Phoslo
      Glycopyrrolate

You are to contact your primary care doctor or go to the
emergency room if you experience severe headaches that are not
relieved with medication, sudden loss of vision or severe eye
pain, confusion, chest pain, or any other symptom that is
concerning to you.

Followup Instructions:
