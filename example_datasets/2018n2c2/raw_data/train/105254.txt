normal; 24-hr urine metanephrine pending. He was started on
lisinopril 20 mg qday. Three days later, BP was still high, and
his lisinopril was increased to 40 mg qday and labetolol 100 [**Hospital1 **]
was added. Outpatient nephrologist suggested renal MRI for
further work-up of his elevated creatinine. He went back to the
PCP's office the day of admission when his BP was found to be
unchanged; labetolol was added. With persistent headache, he
presented to the ED. He denies any visual changes, chest pain,
shortness of breath, weakness.

including optic disc exam, was unremarkable. Cr. was 1.8. He was
started on nitroprusside at 0.25 mcg/kg/min and his SBP dropped
quickly to 160. Nitroprusside was decreased to 0.15 mcg/kg/min.
By transfer to MICU, his BP was 180/100, HR 70s. He received one
Percocet for his headache.

Imaging:
Renal U/S w/ doppler: IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass lesion.
Renal parenchyma is normal in appearance.
2. Doppler interrogation of the kidneys demonstrates normal
velocities in the main renal arteries. Resistive indices are
within normal limits in the
interlobar arteries, though there are characteristic
tarud/parvus waveforms, suggesting possible renal artery
stenosis or fibromuscular dyhsplasia. Further evaluation with
MRI should be considered.

N/C Head CT: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

Admission ECG: Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Early
repolarization. No previous tracing available for comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
38-year-old African-American man with recently diagnosed
hypertension presented with 5 days of headache, found to have
SBP in 200-210, admitted to MICU on nitroprusside drip.
.
# HTN: His SBP was in the 170s on arrival to the MICU. The
nitroprusside was discontinued after 2 hours, after the
initiation of labetolol 200 mg PO bid. His SBP remained in
140s-160s overnight then increased to 180s-190s. Labetolol was
uptitrated to 200 mg PO tid. His headache decreased but still
persisted. No visual changes, chest pain, shortness of breath.
Blood pressure rose back to 200.  Nitroglycerin drip was
started.  Labetalol was uptitrated; HCTZ was added.  Hydralazine
was given for short-acting effect.  The next morning the
nitroglycerin was titrated off and the patient did well.  He was
transferred to the floor on labetalol 600mg [**Hospital1 **], amlodipine 10mg
daily and HCTZ 25mg daily.  He did well with SBPs to in the 140
to 160 range.  His headaches improved.  He was discharged with
close follow-up to repeat BP checks.
.
# Acute kidney injury: Cr. 1.8, from 1.5 at PCP's office on
Monday. Recent increase might be due to initiation of ACE
inhibitor, so his lisinopril was held. Renal ultrasound should
normal appearing kidneys, but was concerning for possible RAS or
fibromuscular dysplasia. FENa was 1.1%. Nephrology was consulted
and saw rare muddy-brown casts concerning for ATN. Concerning
for FSGS as well.  HIV was negative.  His Cr initially
stabilized, then rose slightly to 2.3 on the day of discharge.
However, he was making good amounts of urine and had no
electrolyte disturbances.  He was discharged with instructions
to follow-up closely with his PCP with repeat lab tests.  He
will also see a nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 86557**].  He should a kidney
MRA as an outpatient once his creatinine clearance has improved.

 If you have recurrent headaches, check your blood pressure and
call your doctor.  If your headache is severe and you can't get
