none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 82 year-old Spanish speaking female with a history of
CAD s/p recent BMS to RCA, type II DM, hyperlipidemia,
hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation admitted following
a fall.  Pt was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 34801**] from the
cardiology service with NSTEMI and had a BMS to RCA and new
atrial fibrillation.  She was started on antiplatelet therapy
and started on anticoagulation.  Pt notes that she has been
having fatigue and lethargy dating back to this hospitalization.
 This AM she woke up to use the bathroom, when she felt her
"balance was off" and fell.  Fall witnessed by her husband.  She
hit her head on falling.  She denies prodromes of
lightheadedness, palpitations, or chest pain.  No LOC.  Per her
daughter, she fell 2 days prior, attributed to poor balance,
resulting in trauma to her right foot.  She notes poor PO intake
for 1 week due to poor appetite.  Denies nausea, vomitting, or
loose stools.  Notes constipation and is currently on
"laxatives."  +Increasing cold intolerance.  Also with dysuria
and chills dating back to prior admission.

In the field found to have FSG 30, given 1 amp D50.  FSG 51 on
arrival to ED.  Given another 1 amp D50, serum glucose
subsequently 256.  In the ED, hypothermic to T 32, started on
beg hugger.  Also with hyponatremia to 120, given 2 L warmed NS.
 Also given ceftriaxone 1 gm for concern for sepsis without
clear source given hypothermia and hypoglycemia.  Imaging
notable for CT abd/pelv without acute process, CT head and neck
notable for retrolisthesis of C5-C6 of unclear acuity.  Seen by
spine c/s in ED and c-spine cleared.  Decadron 10 mg given for
?adrenal insufficiency.

ROS: The patient denies any fevers, weight change, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, chest
pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity
edema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, lightheadedness, focal
weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

2. Diabetes Mellitus, type 2 - on insulin
3. Hypertension
4. Hyperlipidemia
5. Cataracts s/p surgical repair x2
6. Proliferative Retinopathy

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current or
former tobacco use. There is no history of alcohol or drug
abuse. She lives with her husband and is able to perform ADLs.

ECG: Sinus bradycardia to 55, LBBB, LAD, no acute ST/T changes

Imaging:
CXR ([**2-16**]):  Mild volume overload, cardiomegaly, increased
pulmonary vascular prominence

CT Head ([**2-16**]):
1. Very small left parietovertex scalp subcutaneous hematoma.
2. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
3. No evidence of acute major territorial infarct. However, MRI
with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive for evaluation
of acute ischemia.

CT C-spine ([**2-16**]):
1. No evidence of acute fracture.
2. Moderately severe degenerative changes within the cervical
spine with
grade 1 retrolisthesis of C5 on C6. Given the degenerative
findings, acuity this is likely chronic; however, there is
ventral canal narrowing at this and the C4-C5 level, and MRI of
the cervical spine is recommended if myelopathic symptoms
suggest acute cord injury.
3. Multilevel spinal stenosis secondary to disc bulges and
herniations and
spondylosis.

CT abd/pelvis ([**2-16**]):
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal infection. No acute abdominal
pathology.
2. 13 x 8 mm mural nodule along the right posterior bladder wall
which is
concerning for malignancy. Recommend further evaluation with
urine cytology and/or cystoscopy.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
82 year-old Spanish speaking female with a history of CAD s/p
recent BMS to RCA, type II DM, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation admitted with hypothermia and
hyponatremia.

# Hypothermia:
# Hypoglycemia:

# Hyponatremia:

# CAD: Recent BMS to RCA, pt was continued on home ASA, plavix,
statin.

# Hypertension: Antihypertensives initially held.  She was
restarted on her BB and [**Last Name (un) **] at lower doses.  They should be
titrated up as needed.

# Atrial fibrillation: Currently in NSR, on coumadin for
anticoagulation.  Lovenox held (had been on lovenox bridge to
coumadin from prior hospitalization) given extensive bruising on
her abdomen.  Coumadin titrated up to 5 mg at time of transfer.


# Mass Along Bladder: On her CT scan from ED, she was noted to
have a mass on the posterior aspect of her bladder concerning
for malignancy.  She had a urine cytology sent which is
currently pending and should have urology follow up for possible
cystoscopy.

# Left toe laceration: Secondary to fall, per preliminary
report, cannot rule out extension into bone. As her hypothermia
has resolved and there is little suscipicion of infection and
her exam benign, further imaging deferred.

82 spanish speaking F with afib, CAD s/p recent BMS to RCA, dm2,
admitted with fall, hyponatremia, hypothermia, hypoglycemia.
Pt initially presnted with hypothermia, bradycardia and
hyponatremia, concerning for hypothyroidism.  TSH however was
wnl.  Sepsis unlikely given pt hemodynamic stable and no clear
source for infection (symptom of dysuria in setting of foley
catheter, clean u/a), adrenal insufficiency also unlikely. Given
negative work up and occurence with hypoglycemia, hypothermic
episode most likely [**2-23**] her hypoglycemic episode.  She received
external warming and her temperature normalized on the first day
of her hospital stay.  Blood and urine cultures remained
negative throughout her ICU stay.

.
1. Fall/ C5-6 retrolisthesis:
Fall sounds mechanical in nature. CT showed C5-6 retrolisthesis.
c-spine was cleared by Neurosurgery in ED. Neuro exam remains
non-focal
- PT consult
- no events on tele except bradycardia - approx 50
.
# Hypothermia:
This resolved with simple warming measures, was likely [**2-23**]
hypoglycemia. There was initial concern for possible sepsis,
though bld cx and urine cx are NGTD. TSH wnl.
.
# Hypoglycemia/Type II Diabetes, controlled with complications:

Hypoglycemia was in setting of poor PO and continued long acting
insulin, now resolved.  Also, it was found that pt's husband
administer's patient's insulin, but does not have a clear method
for calculating dose of insulin, and it appears that pt does not
even check her glucose daily or even weekly.  Nursing spent
significant time educating patient, husband and daughter about
the need for frequent daily glucose monitoring, and the use of a
sliding scale.  Patient was discharged on NPH and sliding scale,
as used during the hospitalization.
Recommend that patient have geriatrics consult with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 713**]
after discharge.

.
# Hyponatremia:
Pt noted to have hypovolemic hyponatremia on admission,
corrected with hydration.  She was encouraged to increase her PO
intake.
 Sodium runs baseline in 130s likely [**2-23**] diuretics.
.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure, EF 50%:
currently euvolemic
- patient returned to her home dosing of cardiac medications
prior to discharge.
.

# Mass Along Bladder: On her CT scan from ED, she was noted to
have a mass on the posterior aspect of her bladder concerning
for malignancy.  She had a urine cytology sent which is
currently pending and should have urology follow up for possible
cystoscopy.
**Please follow up**
.
# CAD:
Recent BMS to RCA. No active CP symptoms, trop 0.07, though
baseline mildly elevated, ECG with LBBB
- Cont home ASA, plavix, statin, BB
.
# Chronic renal failure, Stage III:
cr 1.3 at baseline
- Cr currently at baseline
.
# Atrial fibrillation:
now in SR
- c/w coumadin, INR 1.9 at discharge
- c/w metoprolol
.
# Anemia:
hct 26.3, baseline around 30, has remained stable since
admission.
