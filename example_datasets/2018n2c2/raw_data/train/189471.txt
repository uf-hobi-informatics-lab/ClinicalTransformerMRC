Chief Complaint:
weakness, bradycardia and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement and removal


History of Present Illness:
(PER MICU ADMITTING TEAM)
74F with h/o CAD, DMII, CHF (unknown EF), Afib, and COPD
presenting with weakness.  As per family, patient had been well
in USOH until beginning of [**Month (only) **] when she developed flu-like
symptoms.  Myalgias continued for several days followed by
development of n/v/diarrhea on [**12-29**].  History was
characterized by almost daily diarrhea (watery, non-bloody) and
vomiting after most meals (occurring 30min to 1hr, non-bloody).
Only able to take small amounts of food/water.  Denies
fevers/chills/rigors/abd pain.  Family describes that patient
increasingly fatigued and tired.  Too weak and tired to present
to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3011**] -> came into ED by family.
.
In ED, initially triaged w/ bp 148/86, on re-check in triage
found to be hypotensive 70/20 w/ HR 39.  Treated for symptomatic
bradycardia [**1-24**] BB o/d -> rec'd 1amp cacl, 0.5mg atropine, [**12-24**]
amp d5 (bs was 73), then 1 amp sodium bicarb and glucagon.
Again rec'd atropine, cacl, and glucagon. Also 2L NS, CTX 1g x1.
Uo in ED 700cc.
.
(PER FLOOR ADMITTING TEAM)
Briefly, patient is a 74F CAD, DMII, CHF (EF 70%), COPD who was
admitted to the MICU for bradycardia and hypotension. She had
presented to the ED with several weeks of
nausea/vomiting/diarrhea; she was found to be in acute renal
failure with Cr 6.7, which was treated with IV fluid boluses;
she was treated for symptomatic bradycardia with atropine,
calcium gluconate, and glucagon. Bradycardia was thought to be
[**1-24**] decreased clearance of nodal agents, and they were held,
with improvement of bradycardia. Hypotension was attributed to
dehydration, Cr improved with fluids.  Nausea/Vomiting was
attributed to ARF, which improved with improved hydration, and
patient was able to tolerate solid fluids evening before
transfer to floor. On interview, patient reported she was
feeling well and denied any complaints of difficulty breathing,
abdominal pain, chest pain, or nausea/vomiting. Patient did
report lethargy.

HEAD CT
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
.
PORTABLE CXR
IMPRESSION: Similar mild cardiomegaly, but no acute
cardiopulmonary process
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN
IMPRESSION: Somewhat prominent small bowel and large bowel gas
pattern.
.
RENAL U/S
IMPRESSION: Bilateral nephrolithiasis. The numerous calculi seen
in the left kidney with obstruction of the left upper pole
raises the suspicion of a staghorn calculus. This is confirmed
on the prior CT scan from [**2170-8-23**].
.
ECHO
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 74 year-old female with CAD, DMII, CHF, AFib, and
COPD who was initially admitted to the MICU for bradycardia,
hypotension, and acute renal failure. The following issues were
addressed during her hospital stay:
.
# HYPOTENSION/BRADYCARDIA
In the MICU, hypotension/bradycardia was attributed to decreased
clearance of nodal agents in setting of ARF (vs. accidental
overdose on medications). Patient responded well to IV fluid
boluses and withholding of anti-hypertensives (patient was on
significant doses of Coreg and Cartia). Clinical suspicion for
tamponade was low, and no pulsus on exam was noted; ECHO
confirmed clinical suspicion. On transfer to the floor,
hypotension was no longer an issue, and medications were
cautiously added at lower dosages. Patient to follow-up with PCP
and cardiologist for further titration of medications as
tolerated.
.
# DIARRHEA/NAUSEA/VOMITING/ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
Patient without history of renal insufficiency admitted with Cr
of 6.7. Patient with long course of what appeared to be viral
gastrointestinal illness precipitating dehydration and worsening
renal function. No other source could be identified, stool
assays were unremarkable. Renal U/S was with evidence of
nephrolithiasis with focal hydronephrosis, but this was
unchanged from a prior study. ARF was pre-renal in nature, and
highly responsive to IV fluid hydration. Patient's Cr steadily
improved to 0.9 on discharge. Patient was referred to Urology as
an outpatient for further work-up of kidney stones. Patient's
nausea/vomiting improved as renal function returned to baseline,
and patient was tolerating PO meals x 48 hours at time of
discharge.
.
# CHF
Lasix was initially held in setting of hypotension. Clinical
exam for the first several days remained without evidence of
fluid overload. ECHO showed 4+ TR, patient highly pre-load
dependent. Lasix and Spironolactone were added back as blood
pressure improved. To follow-up with outpatient cardiologist.
.
# CAD
Patient was chest-pain free on admission. Serial cardiac enzymes
were negative for acute coronary syndrome, in investigating
etiology for bradycardia and hypotension. ASA and Zocor were
continued at outpatient dosages. Quinapril was held secondary to
above reasons, and added back when tolerated.
.
# COPD
Patient was maintained on Atrovent QID, and was without
difficulty breathing or desaturation as inpatient.
.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
Patient's INR was supratherapeutic on admission. Coumadin was
re-started once INR < 3.
