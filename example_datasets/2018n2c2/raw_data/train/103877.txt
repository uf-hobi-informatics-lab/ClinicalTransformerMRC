Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 85 year old male with history of diastolic heart
failure, copmlete heart block (s/p PPM [**6-7**]) ESRD on HDHD, h/o
MRSA bacteremia and thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to drug
reaction (PPI?) who presented from [**Hospital 100**] rehab with dyspnea.
Initially admitted to MICU with dyspnea and ? CO2 retention
requiring BiPAP. Pt was called out to the floor and did well for
several days.  He was then noted to be hypoxic at dialysis.  he
also underwent therapeutic thoracentesis on right side with good
relief.  The following morning, he was found to be somnolent
with myoclonic jerking.  ABG demonstrated 7.24/70/89 on 3 L/min.
 He was transferred back to the MICU for ? bipap.  He was noted
to be continually hypercarbic throughout his admission.

Pt's BPs continued to drop and he became unable to tolerate HD.
On the day prior to death, dialysis had to be stopped
prematurely (removed 2.2L) due to hypoxia and hypotension.  The
morning of his death, he was noted to be acutely hypoxic and
hypercarbic.  CXR revealed a collapsed left lung and increase in
right sided pleural effusion.  Discussed situation with family
and it was decided to not escalate care (had been decided upon
to make him DNR/DNI the night before).  Over the course of the
day, he became increasinly hypoxic, hypercarbic, acidotic, and
hypotensive.  He was pronounced deat at 17:25 on [**2133-8-25**].
Family was present and declined autopsy.
.
#.  Dyspnea:  Patient presented from rehab with acute dyspnea
and SOB with walking the day of admission likley from increasing
pleural effusions. Patient had been afebrile, without
leukocytosis, bandemia or cough making PNA very unlikely. Given
that CTX/Levaquin/Vanco started in the ED were D/Ced. Nephrology
was notified that the patient was admitted and Pt was sent to HD
for ultrafiltration on the day of transfer off of the MICU. CEs
were negative.

#. End Stage Renal Disease:  Patient on MWF HD treatments. Pt
continued HD as an in patient with removal of excess fluid.

#. C Diff colitis: Patient with (+) C diff tox x 3 during
admission in [**Month (only) 205**].  On Vanco at [**Hospital 100**] rehab until [**2133-8-24**].
Vanco 250mg PO QID was continued as an in patient.

#. Diastolic heart failure: Last ECHO [**2133-7-17**] with EF >55% and
mild mitral regurgitation. HD was done as above.

#. Atrial Fibrillation: Patient is currently V-paced. We
continued outpatient amiodarone. Anticoagulation was held given
recent history of GI bleed.

#. Thrombocytopenia: Thought to be [**1-31**] to drug reaction one
month ago (PPI), currently at 61, down from 113 at last
admisstion. This suggests the possibility of MDS. Follow up with
a hematologist may be indicate in the future as an outpatient,
but since the remainder of his counts are WNL no H/O consult was
called.
