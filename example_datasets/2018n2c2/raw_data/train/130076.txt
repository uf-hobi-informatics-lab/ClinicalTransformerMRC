Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter placed [**2148-8-3**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 73yo male with CAD s/p CABG or STENT?, Hodgkins
Lymphoma, recent admission in [**Month (only) 116**] for extensive bilateral
femoral vein clots, who presents with dyspnea, cough, hypoxemia,
found to have b/l pulmonary embolisms.
Of note, this patient was admitted to oncology from [**Date range (1) **]
for bilateral DVTs of common femoral, superficial femoral,
politeal,
and calf veins. At that time, he was started Dalteparin
(Fragmin) daily for treatment of this. He reports that he had
been compliant with this.
The patient reports that he has been feeling short of breath for
several months. When he left the hospital last [**Month (only) 116**], he was short
of breath, and this has been worsening since then. He reports
that his excercise tolerance has worsened progressively since
being discharged from the hospital. He feels short of breath
with mininal exertion. He also reports coughing nightly for the
past few days. This morning, he "just couldnt take it anymore"
and decided to come in. He denies any acute worsening in his
breathing, and reports that it has been progressive.
On review of systems. He denies chest pain, palpations. has
cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion. denies fevers.
reports chills and feeling cold all of the time. reports 10
pounds of unintentional recent weight loss. all other review of
systems negative.
In the ER, intial vitals were 103/43, HR 96, RR 22, O2sat 77% on
RA. Reportedly altered when hypoxic, but mental status improved
once on oxygen. A CTA was done showing clot in right main
pulmonary artery and branch arteries in the LLL. He was started
on heparin. He also remains hypoxemic. Attempt was made to put
him in 6l NC, but he became tachpyneic and [**Last Name (LF) 52536**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] is now
back on NRB.


Past Medical History:
- Crohn's disease diagnosed in [**2147**].
- Hypercholesterolemia.
- Hypertension.
- Carotid stenosis status post bilateral CEA
- Barrett's esophagus.
- CAD s/p stent [**2-18**] (was on plavix stopped [**5-18**])
- TIA.
- seizure disorder
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: - s/p bilateral CEA ~ 5 years ago
- s/p L shoulder surgery

Social History:
doesnt currently smoke, but quit 20 years ago. smoked 10 years,
[**2-10**] pack a day, so 5packyears. used to drink 1 glass wine daily,
but hasnt in the past few months. Lives with wife

Family History:
parents had MIs in old age. one granddaughter with asthma.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 98.2 BP: 98/56 P: 85 R: 25 18 O2: 95% on NRB
General: Alert, oriented, clearly short of breath with speaking

HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: mostly Clear to auscultation bilaterally, rhonchi clear
with cough.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
Ext: b/l edema left worse than right.


Pertinent Results:
[**7-31**] CTA
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute PE involving right main/branch and left lower lobe
pulmonary
arteries. No evidence of right heart strain.
2. Diffuse bilateraly pulmonary ground-glass opacities may be
due to
pulmonary edema/ARDS, although infection/inflammation or
hemorrhage not
excluded. Superimposed infarction cannot be excluded.
3. Mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes may be reactive.

[**2148-8-14**] CT Chest:
1. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacities most
likely represent infection or inflammation; however, the
differential diagnosis also includes pulmonary edema,
hemorrhage, or superimposed infarction.
2. Stable mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
3. Persistent pulmonary embolism involving the right main
pulmonary artery
extending into the right middle and lower lobes but with no
evidence of right heart strain.
4. Bilateral small pleural effusions with associated compressive
atelectasis.
5. Subcentimeter lesion in segment I/VI of the liver, too small
to
characterize, but may represents a hepatic cyst. Recommend
attention on
followup.
6. Clots in left external iliac vein, right common femoral, and
left common femoral veins.
7. Hypodensity in the upper pole of the right kidney is most
consistent with a renal cyst. Bilateral hypodensities are too
small to characterize but likely represent renal cysts.

Brief Hospital Course:
When patient came to the ED on [**2148-7-31**], his initial intial
vitals were 103/43, HR 96, RR 22, O2sat 77% on RA. He was
altered when hypoxic, but mental status improved once on oxygen.
A CTA was done showing clot in right main pulmonary artery and
branch arteries in the LLL. He was started on heparin.  Attempt
was made to put him in 6 L NC, but he became tachpyneic and
[**Last Name (LF) 52536**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he went back on a non-rebreather. He was then
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

[**2148-8-24**]:

Clinically deteriorated: febrile all day (never defervesed - t
max 103.6), increased secretions and cough. less alert.
desaturated on [**11-17**] PSV/CPAP with 50% Fio2 and sinus
tachycardic to 150s-160s. Pan-cultured. U/A negative. Initially
thought it was [**3-12**] agitation/delirium - was given Zyprexa. Also
thought pt had large cuff leak contributing to increased
secretions and aspiration leading to VAP. Thoracics came back
and was unimpressed. Thought trach looked fine and was more
concerned with clinical picture. Still agitated, given Versed
for sedation. Continued to be agitated, febrile and tachycardic.
Given fluid boluses. Tachycardia persisted. CXR - increased
haziness bilaterally from morning CXR; EKG: sinus tachycardia.
Continued to desaturate. Placed on CMV (TV 500, RR 14, FIO2
100%, PEEP 10). Pressures began to drop to 80-90s systolic. More
fluid given. Not responsive. Started on Neo. A-line placed. ABG:
7.43/35/82/27 on 100% FIO2. Deeply sedated with propofol and
fentanyl. Family made aware of clinical status and requested
that we persist with current measures.
- Other considerations: changing NGT to OGT; starting antifungal

11-3am: attempts were made to wean patient off 100% FIO2,
however did not tolerate. patient pressure continued to drop.
