Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6743**]
Chief Complaint:
dysgerminoma of the right ovary

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
diagnostic laparoscopy
total abdominal hysterectomy
left salpingoopherectomy
pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection
omentectomy
cystoscopy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 45 yo P0 who presented following discovery of
disgerminoma of the right ovary.  Dr. [**Known lastname **] was in
her usual state of good health until [**2159-6-12**].  She
presented at that time to [**Hospital 1559**] Medical Center with acute
severe abdominopelvic pain.  She was found to have a torsion of
the right ovary and underwent an emergent exploratory
laparotomy,
right salpingo-oophorectomy.  Final pathology revealed a 15 cm
serous cystadenoma of the ovary with a 1 cm disgerminoma of the
ovary focussed within the center.  She had this surgery through
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 22790**] incision and has healed well from that surgery.
Pathology has been read here at [**Hospital1 188**].  The disgerminoma is identified as well as the serous
cyst.  The report was that the ovary was intact without surface
involvement.  The serous cyst was separate.  The patient has had
laboratory evaluations performed postoperatively and these
include an LDH level which is normal, an inhibin level which
evidently was normal, hCG level normal.  She had normal liver
function tests and blood counts as well.  She has been advised
after an evaluation at the [**Hospital 1559**] Medical Center to undergo a
staging laparotomy including hysterectomy, left

CT-A
IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly limited exam secondary to motion and body habitus
however no
pulmonary embolus in the central or segmental pulmonary
arteries.
2. Scattered upper lobe predominent bilateral peribronchiolar
nodular
opacities which may be due to an infectious/inflammatory
etiology or
aspiration. Bilateral lower lobes and lingular atelectasis.
3. Diffuse low attenuation of the liver compatible with fatty
infiltration.


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**9-24**], she underwent diagnostic laparoscoy, converted
to open total abdominal hysterectomy, left salpingoopherectomy,
pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, omentectomy, and
cystoscopy.  Procedure was converted due to difficulty accessing
the lymph nodes.  Please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 27357**] operative note for
full details.

Postoperatively, the patient received a TAP block for pain in
the PACU.  She developed tachycardia to 130s.  Preoperatively,
the patient had been tachycardic to 110s.   The patient had
received 6L IV fluids and maintained good UOP.  She also
received 13mg IV morphine and RR went down to 8.   Arterial
blood gas demonstrated hypercarbia with pCO2 to 59.  No
pre-operative Hct was drawn, but the post-op HCT was 27.5.  Her
02 sat was 82% on RA and up to mid 90s on CPAP.  The decision
was made to transfer the patient to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for further
management.  On arrival to the ICU the patient's 02 sat 99% on
2L, she was alert, oriented and RR 15, not complaining of any
pain.  She had a one-night [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.

The following were addressed during the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay:

1) Hypoxia:
Her hypoxia was likely multifactorial, associated with
atelectasis and low RR in the setting of a high morphine dose.
The CXR was consistent with atelectasis.  Patient also noted to
have some snoring and full neck likely associated with some
degree of sleep apnea.  She was ruled out for pulmonary embolism
with CT-A. The CT did suggest possible aspiration versus
infectious etiology with "scattered bilateral
peribronchovascular opacities."  At the time of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] call-out,
the patient was saturating 98% on 2L oxygen by nasal canula,
which was stable from her presentation to the ICU, mildly
improved.

2) Sinus Tachycardia:
Her sinus tachycardia was of unclear etiology, though clearly
documented prior to going to the OR.  The patient clearly denied
pain, anxiety; her post-op pain was controlled with dilaudid
PCA.  She did describe some difficulty with bowel prep that
could have caused dehydration, but the tachycardia did not
resolve with 6L IVFs despite orbital edema.  Her post-operative
fever could have been contributing to the tachycardia as well.
Telemetry was discontinued upon transfer to the GYN oncology
service.

3) Fever:
The patient spiked a fever to 102.5 the evening of POD#0.  CTA
was suggestive of possible aspiration pneumonia as an etiology.

4) Anemia:
Hematocrit at time of transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was 24.  She was
transfused 1 unit of pRBCs in the ICU in addition to 2 units of
pRBCs she had received intraoperatively in the PACU.

The patient was transferred to the gyn oncology service on
POD#1.  The remainder of her hospital stay was notable for the
following:

1) Apiration pneumonia:
The patient was successfully weaned to room air on gyn oncology
service.  Given that her temperature was still elevated to 101.2
at the time of transfer, she was started on IV clindamycin
empirically for treatment of aspiration pneumonia.  Urine
culture was negative, and blood cultures were still pending at
the time of hospital discharge.  Following initiation of
clindamycin, she remained afebrile for over 24 hours.  She then
respiked to a low grade temperature of 100.6.  Urinalysis was
negative.  CXR was repeated, demonstrating bibasilar opacities
concerning for ongoing aspiration pneumonia.  The patient
spontaneously defervesced, and remained afebrile for the
remainder of her hospital stay.  Clindamycin was discontinued
and levofloxacin initiated.  The patient received 24 hours of IV
levofloxacin and was discharged home on po levofloxacin.  Within
24 hours of discharge, the patient called informing that
insurance would not cover po levofloxacin.  She was switched to
a 10 day course of augmentin and azithromycin.

2) Nausea/emesis
The patient experienced an episode of nausea with small amount
of bilious emesis on POD#3.  Diet was retracted from full
liquids back to NPO with resolution of symptoms.  Diet was
successfully advanced the following day.

She was discharged home on POD#5 in good condition: tolerating a
regular diet, ambulating and voiding without difficulty,
afebrile, saturating well on room air.
