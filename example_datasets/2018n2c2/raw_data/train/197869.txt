Brief Hospital Course:
56 year old man with a history of chronic L>R painful lymphedema
was admitted to the hospital on [**2207-8-16**] with severe cellulitis
which we treated with aggressive ACE wrap and elevation, IV
antibiotics and IV diuresis. Despite antibiotics (vanco, cipro,
flagyl and zosyn) his WBC continues to rise with low grade
temps.   He also developed a new erythema over trunk so ID was
consulted on [**2207-8-20**]. His antibiotics were discontinued and he
was started on ceftaroline.  His cellulitis and rash slowly
improved though his unremitting pain in his LLE continued to
persist. After discussion with palliative care, chronic pain
services and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the decision was made to go forward
with a Left BKA to improve Mr. [**Known lastname 36515**] quality of life which
was performed (guillotine) on [**2207-8-23**].  At this point, his
antibiotic was then changed to Linezolid.  He returned to the OR
on [**2207-8-28**] for Re-amputation and closure of left below-knee
amputation.  Post operatively in the PACU, he required a brief
reintubation secondary to hypoxia. His CXR was consistent with
pulmonary edema.  He was monitored overnight in the CVICU then
transferred to the floor.

On the floor, he has made steady progress. He has remained
afebrile with baseline renal function and hemodynamically
stable.  He has worked with PT who recommended rehab.
In terms of his medications:
- We weaned his oxycontin from 40mg/day to 30mg/ day on [**2207-9-1**].
 He is due to have it decreased again on [**2207-9-3**]. Since the BKA
he has had minimal pain.
- He was restarted on coumadin on [**2207-9-1**] secondary to his
atrial fibrillation with [**Country **] score of 3.
- We did not restart  Moexipril 30 mg twice daily secondary to
ongoing aggressive diuresis and borderline renal function.
- He will continue on the linezolid until his postop check on
next week.

Medications on Admission:
 ASA325, Amlodipine 10, Carvedilol 25 [**Hospital1 **], Clobestasol qAM,
Furosemide 40'', Glipizide 5, Moexipril 30'', Rosuvastatin 5,

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with worsening left lower
extremity swelling, infection and unremitting pain. Despite
aggressive treatment of your venostasis, profound lymphedema
with elephantiasis, and arterial ischemia we were unable to
adequately control your pain.  It was decided that a below-knee
amputation was the best course of action.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWING  AMPUTATION
ACTIVITY: There are restrictions on activity. On the side of
your amputation you are non weight bearing for 4-6 weeks. You
should keep this amputation site elevated when ever possible.
Avoid any pressure to your amputation site.

You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots.
No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.

PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:
Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s).
New pain, numbness or discoloration of your foot or toes.

Exercise:Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks. No heavy lifting
greater than 20 pounds for the next 3 weeks. Try to keep leg
elevated when able.

BATHING/SHOWERING:
You may shower immediately upon coming home. No baths or
swimming. You may leave your incision open to air. Wash your
incision(s) gently with soap and water. You will have sutures,
which are usually removed in 4 weeks.

WOUND CARE:
Keep your wound clean and dry. If there is any drainage cover
with a dry sterile gauze and let your doctor know.

MEDICATIONS:
We started you on a new medication called coumadin to prevent
blood clots from your atrial fibrillation.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36516**], your PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] monitor your INRs and adjust your coumadin dose as needed.
Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the
medications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a
new prescription for pain medication to be taken if necessary.

We restarted your coumadin on [**2207-9-1**].  Your PCP will manage
your coumadin when you are discharged to home.  We have also
decreased your pain medications.  You were taking 20mg twice
daily of oxycontin prior to admission.  On [**2207-9-1**], we decreased
you oxycontin to 20mg in the AM and 10mg at night.  They will
continue to wean this medication at rehab as tolerated.
