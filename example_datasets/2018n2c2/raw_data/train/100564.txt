be tolerating well. Over the past 2-3 weeks he has had worsening
chest pain. CTA on [**1-3**] revealed no PE and he was evaluated on
by his thoracic surgeon for incisional pain but it was not felt
to be due to the incisions. He continued to have vague pain
radiating to his shoulders and biceps bilaterally but didn't
notice any facial or arm swelling. There was concern that his
portacath was malfunctioning since it infused well but nursing
had difficulty withdrawing from it so he was sent for portacath
flow study. Study revealed no flow into the SVG with thrombus
surrouding the catheter and extending beyond the catheter tip.
After discussion between IR and Heme/Onc plan was made to
transfer him to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for tPA infusion.

Port a cath study-
IMPRESSION:  Left-sided port with diffuse peri-catheter thrombus
including thrombus beyond the distal tip, no antegrade flow from
the port into the superior vena cava.  Findings were discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (un) 5561**] and the patient will be seen in oncology
clinic this day with discussions concerning options such as TPA
through the current port or port removal.


Brief Hospital Course:
43 yo male with hx of rectal CA, DMII, and histoplasmosis now
presents with SVC partial thrombosis now admitted to ICU for
thrombolysis.
.
1. SVC thrombosis-The patient initially presented with vague
chest, shoulder and arm pain. Also, his port was not functioning
well. A subsequent port study showed clot diffuse peri-catheter
thrombus including thrombus beyond the distal tip, no antegrade
flow from the port into the superior vena cava. He may be
hypercoagulable  due to CA. We initially infused tpa at 1mg/hr
for 8 hours followed by another 8 hours of 1/2mg/hr, per IR
protocol. However a subsequent port study showed persistance of
the clot. TPA was stopped. Surgery was consulted and a decision
was made to remove the port. He tolerated the procedure well and
was started on lovenox post-op.

2. Rectal CA-Pt not yet staged. Pt. will continue with continue
XRT as an outpatient. His 5-fu was changed to Xeloda per
HemeOnc. Will hold on XRT per Rad Onc while managing thrombosis
issue.
.
3. DMII- We held glyburide while he was NPO and maintained on a
RISS. His glyburide was restarted after his procedure.

4. Diarrhea- likely related to 5FU. Resolved during his stay.
