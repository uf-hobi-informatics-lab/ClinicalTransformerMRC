percocet on [**2103-3-5**] and was withdrawing through the week. She

not seek medical care. He continued to withdraw and on [**2103-3-13**]
she noted that he was hallucinating but was able to be
redirected. He continued to get worse and went to his
grandmother's house to be around a familiar environment. He
continued to hallucinate and appears to have called an ambulance
which took him to [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**Hospital1 189**]. He was transferred
to [**Hospital3 8063**] which propmtly sent him to [**Hospital1 18**]. He was
apparently having paranoid delusion. During his time in the ED,
he was managed for hypokalemia and sent back to [**Hospital1 **]. He
spent the night at [**Hospital1 **] but got progressively more
confused and combatative and was put in restraints. He was given
3mg PO ativan, 100mg PO benadryl, 5mg PO haldol, and 200mg
thorazine over 6 hours, with reportedely minimal effect and was
sent back to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern of DT's.
.
In the ED, patient was initially diaphoretic, agitated,
hallucinating, and tachycardic to 130's. He was taken straight
to psychiatric seclusion room with security presence. Initial
labs were notable for leukocytosis to 11.3 without significant
left shift.  Patient received 1LNS with 100mg thiamine, 1mg
folate and MVI. Also received 10mg po valium and 6mg IM and IV
lorazepam. On repeat exam, he was noted to be sleeping
peacefully. Prior to transfer, vitals were: Temp: 97.5 ??????F,
Pulse: 89, RR: 26, BP: 120/68, O2Sat: 99. He was given an
additional 2mg IV ativan just prior to transfer to floor for
worsening agitation.
.
On the floor the patient was noted to be hallucinating and
agitated which required restraints. He was given 2mg of IV
ativan and a liter of NS. Due to concern for DT's the MICU was
consulted and the patient was transferred to the ICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was in restraints and
agitated. He was making inappropriate remarks and appeared to be
actively hallucinating. He was given 10mg of valium.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION

ACTIVE PROBLEMS
# Benzodiazepine withdrawal: Patient presented from [**Hospital1 **] with active hallucinations, agitation, tremors and
tachycardia. He was minimally responsive to external
stimulation. Due to his active hallucinations there was concern
for Delerium Tremens which is defined by hallucinations,
disorientation, tachycardia, hypertension, fever, agitation, and
diaphoresis.  Once he arrived in the MICU he was loaded with po
valium 10 mg (totoal of 80 mg) q1h until his CIWA was less than
10.  We were quickly able to space out his CIWA to q4h and he
was called out to the medicine floor the following day. On the
medicine floor, he remained on a q4 CIWA scale and was noted not
to score for >24 hours before discharge.

# Substance Abuse: Patient has a significant history of
polysubstance abuse incudling benzo and narcotics. Following
clearance of his eSocial work and psychiatry were consulted and
