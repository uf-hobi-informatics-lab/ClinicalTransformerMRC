None.


History of Present Illness:
64 yo woman w/ h/o recurrent PEs s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter, GIB
while anticoagulated, COPD, who was discharged [**2107-1-12**] after
being treated for new PE presented to the ED with SOB and
productive cough. She was readmitted [**2107-1-17**] after she was
found to have a multifocal pneumonia and was treated with
Levo/Flagyl and Vanco. Cultures were positive for MRSA. Levo and
Flagyl were continued for suspected aspiration PNA. The pt
recovered quickly over since admission and she is now back on
her home O2 requirement. She was getting bridged for her
anticoagulation with Lovenox starting [**1-18**] in preparation for
discharge.  However, she developed severe abdominal pain and a
palpable mass in her L abdomen. A CT was showed a new large
hematoma in the muscles of the left anterior and lateral lower
abdominal and pelvic wall, without any intraperitoneal or
retroperitoneal extent, but with associated mass effect on the
lower abdominal and pelvic bowel loops. Surgery was [**Month/Year (2) 4221**]
and suggested no intervention, but monitoring for now. HCT
dropped 6 points in this setting, but she remained
hemodynamically stable with tachycardia which has been present
throughout her hospital stay (95-115).

She required a total of 5 units PRBC and 4 units FFP
transfusions and was transferred to the MICU for further
monitoring.  Her hematocrit has since been stable with serial
checks.
.
ROS: She has baseline left to mid chest pain with exertion that
is not currently bothering her. She denies current chest pain,
SOB, dysuria, increased urinary frequency. She has stable R knee
pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
64F w/ h/o recurrent PE s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter, GIB on
anticoagulation, COPD, recently admitted for new PE, readmitted
for multifocal PNA, who developed a large abdominal wall
hematoma in the context of enoxaparin injections.

# Multifocal Pneumonia: She was admitted with multifocal
pneumonia. She was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin.  She
completed a 7 day course of levofloxacin.  MRSA was found to
grow in her sputum so she was continued on a 14 day course of
vancomycin. She originally presented with elevated WBC count and
left shift which quickly resolved with the initiation of
antibiotics.  Her productive cough improved as well and she
remained on her baseline home O2 of 2L.  Approximately 4 days
after completion of her 14 day course of Vancomycin, the patient
developed worsening cough, SOB, and upper respiratory symptoms.
A repeat CXR showed evidence of a new consolidation in the RLL.
The patient was started back on Levofloxacin/Flagyl.  Vancomycin
was added to her regimen when blood cultures showed 2/4 bottles
with GPC in clusters and chains.  Additionally, her sputum
culture grew out GNRs.  Levofloxacin was discontinued and
Meropenem was started for concern for Pseudomonas given the
patient's long hospital course.  Her O2 sat remained stable
93-100% on 2L nasal cannula (which is her baseline).  She was
given mucomyst inhaled nebulizers to assist in breaking up thick
sputum.  Her GNRs in the sputum grew out E. coli.  Because of
the sensitivity profile of the E. coli and the patient's allergy
to penicillin and cephalosporins, the patient was continued on
Meropenem.  Her GPCs were found to grow out Coag negative Staph.
 Surveillance cultures had no further growth and the coag
negative staph was thought to likely be a contaminant.  Her
Vancomycin was discontinued.  She will continue a 14 day course
of Meropenem and she was discharged with a PICC to complete this
course.
.
# Pulmonary embolism/DVTs: She has had multiple PEs and has had
one even since the placement of a TrapEase IVC filter. CT during
recent previous hospitalization revealed appropriate location of
filter and CTA on this admission showed improvement of clot.
Admission labwork revealed an INR of 7.9.  Coumadin was thus
held and reversed with FFP and vitamin K given her history of
GIB on anticoagulation.  In the interim, therapeutic lovenox
injections were initiated, but within days of starting, she
developed a large abdominal wall hematoma near to lovenox
injection site.  Once her hematocrit stabilized, she was started
on a heparin gtt with coumadin overlap.  While [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9533**] her
Coumadin with an INR 1.2, she was found to have a large Hct drop
and a CT scan of the abdomen showed a new rectus hematoma.  She
was subsequently transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.
It was decided after her second hematoma while on
anticoagulation, the risks of anticoagulation outweigh the
benefits at this time and she was not anticoagulated.  In terms
of her hypercoagulable workup, it has been negative thus far for
hyperhomocysteinemia, Factor V Leiden and antiphospholipid
antibody. Malignancy workup included a colonoscopy and EGD as
well as CEA, all of which were within normal limits. SPEP
revealed hypogammaglobulinemia, but was otherwise unremarkable.
During her hospital course, she also began to complain of
worsening lower extremity pain.  LENIs were obtained which
showed evidence of extensive, completely occlusive, bilateral
deep venous thrombi extending from the common femoral veins to
the popliteal veins.  Radiology felt that these clots were most
likely acute to subacute in nature.  In this setting,
hematology/oncology saw the patient again to consider the risks
vs benefits of anticoagulation.  Antithrombin III, prothrombin
mutation, Lupus anticoagulation and [**Location (un) 1169**] Venom Viper were
sent to reevaluate the reason for her hypercoagulability.  The
hematology/oncology team still felt that the risks of
coagulation outweigh the potential benefits given that the
patient has had multiple bleeding episodes in the setting of
anticoagulation.

# Abdominal wall hematoma: As mentioned above, she developed a
large left-sided abdominal wall hematoma from a Lovenox
injection site that caused a significant hct drop (originally
28.1-->19.4).  Despite the drop, she remained hemodynamically
stable (has sinus tachycardia at baseline prior to bleed). She
received 3 units prbcs, 4 units FFP. Her hematocrit then
stabilized and once stable, she was restarted on heparin gtt.
Coumadin was re-initiated and heparin gtt was continued while
awaiting her INR to become therapeutic.  While [**Location (un) 9533**] her
Coumadin with an INR 1.2, she was found to have another Hct drop
(25.9-> 22.2) and a CT scan of the abdomen showed a new
right-sided rectus hematoma.  She was subsequently transferred
to the MICU for closer monitoring.  She was given 1 unit FFP and
9 units PRBCs between [**Date range (1) 39125**] until her hematocrit became
stable and she bumped appropriately to transfusion.  It was
decided after her second hematoma while on anticoagulation, the
risks of anticoagulation outweigh the benefits at this time and
she was not anticoagulated.  She has complained of [**6-16**]
abdominal pain with movement and has maintained stable
hematocrits.  Her pain is most likely [**3-11**] to the large rectus
hematoma that will resolve over time.  Her Hct remained stable
after her anticoagulation was discontinued.

# Thoracic mass:  CT chest and abdomen revealed a stable
thoracic mass (stable x 3years) and thought potentially
consistent with neural cyst.  It was not further evaluated by
MRI given its long term stability and also she has metal
hardware in place s/p elbow surgery and facial plates.  It
should be followed up with imaging to ensure it remains
unchanged in the future.

# ? Zoster:  Patient reports having a history of "herpes" on her
right buttock.  During her stay, she developed a tingling,
itchiness and multiple small erythematous skin lesions on her
right buttock over the S2, S3 dermatomal distribution.  There
were no vesicles appreciated.  She was treated with acyclovir.

# Candidal vaginitis:  Treated with fluconazole x 2 with
resolution of symptoms.

# H/o GI bleeding during recent admission: Recent colonoscopy
showed diverticulosis with no active signs of bleeding.  She had
no blood in her stools during this admission even while
anticoagulated.  Her stools were guiac-ed multiple times and
were found to be guiac negative.

# Constipation: She is constipated at baseline and requires
daily scheduled bowel regimen to maintian regularity.

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued on lipitor.

# Depression/SAD: Continued on Prozac, risperdone, wellbutrin,
and klonopin.

# Ulcerative Colitis: Remains in remission.  She was continued
on mesalamine.

# Orthostatic hypotension: She remained asymptomatic even while
ambulating with physical therapy.  She was continued on
midodrine.
