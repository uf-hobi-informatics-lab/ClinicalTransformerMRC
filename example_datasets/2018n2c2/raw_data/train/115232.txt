Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2106-2-15**] 9:06 AM

CHEST: AP portable semi-upright view. The nasogastric tube and
the left internal jugular central venous catheter remain in good
positions. There is interval worsening of bilateral perihilar
and basilar opacities, consistent with increasing congestive
heart failure. There are persistent opacities in the right and
left upper lobe, consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.
Multiple surgical clips are again seen in the upper mid abdomen
and just above the gastroesophageal junction.

IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening congestive heart failure.
2. Unchanged right and left upper lobe pneumonia versus
aspiration.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2106-2-15**] 4:20 PM

CHEST CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Emphysema is again noted,
with multiple bullae in the middle and upper lobes. There are
confluent ground-glass opacities as well as interlobular septal
thickening in both upper lobes, right middle lobe, lingula, and
the superior and anterior portions of the lower lobes. The
opacities are most dense in the upper lobes. Small peripheral
centrilobular ground-glass opacities are present throughout both
lower lobes, similar in appearance to [**2104-7-16**]. While the
centrilobular and confluent ground glass opacities are
consistent with aspiration or pneumonia, presence of
interstitial septal thickening also suggest pulmonary edema.
While there is some nodularity within the opacities, nodular
opacities that were seen in the left upper and right lower lobes
on [**2105-7-16**] are no longer present. There is no evidence of an
abscess.

The trachea, right and left main stem bronchi are mildly
dilated. Mild-to- moderate bronchiectasis is noted in the upper
lobes, right middle lobe and lingula. Dependent secretions are
noted in the trachea.

There are numerous enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, increased
in number and size compared to [**2104-7-16**]. The largest right
superior mediastinal node measures 12 mm in short axis diameter.
The largest upper right paratracheal node measures 11 mm. The
largest lower right paratracheal node measures 9 mm. The largest
right para-aortic node measures 12 mm. The largest subcarinal
node measures 15 mm. The largest right para-esophageal node
measures 13 mm. Numerous subcentimeter nodes are present in both
hila.

There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no
pericardial effusion. Scattered atherosclerotic calcifications
are present in the thoracic aorta. Mural thrombus is noted in
the proximal abdominal aorta.

There is an unchanged ill-defined hypodensity in the right lobe
of the thyroid gland, measuring approximately 2 x 1 cm.

There is an approximately 4 cm hypodense lesion in the lower
pole of the spleen, unchanged compared to the [**2106-2-13**] abdominal
CT, which may represent a splenic infarction. Scattered
calcified granulomas are again noted in the liver. Stones are
again seen in the gallbladder. Surgical clips are again noted in
the porta hepatis and in the region of the gastroesophageal
junction. The imaged portions of the pancreas, adrenal glands,
and kidneys appear unremarkable. The imaged bones appear
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities, confluent in the upper
and middle lobes, consistent with aspiration or pneumonia.
Recurrent interlobular septal thickening is consistent with
superimposed pulmonary edema. Given foci of nodularity,
follow-up is recommended after treatment. No evidence of an
abscess.

2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Mild central tracheal dilatation. Diffuse mild-to-moderate
bronchiectasis in the upper and middle lobes.
4. Increased number and size of mediastinal and bilateral hilar
lymph nodes, which may be reactive. However, metastatic disease
cannot be excluded, and follow-up after treatment is
recommended.
5. Hypodense splenic lesion, unchanged since [**2106-2-13**], compatible
with an infarct.
6. Cholelithiasis.
7. Unchanged hypodense lesion in the right lobe of the thyroid.

[**2106-2-13**]  11:08:22 PM

EKG

Sinus tachycardia. Right bundle-branch block. Compared to
tracing #1, no
diagnostic change.

[**2106-2-13**] 3:20 PM

CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:
Hazy nodular opacities about the airways within the lower lungs
have increased since the prior study consistent with small
airways disease. There is mild hazy opacity within the lung
bases which could represent normal lung at expiration, however
mild ground glass airspace disease cannot be excluded.

There is a hepatic granuloma within the dome of the liver. No
concerning hepatic lesions. There are multiple small gallstones
dependently within the gallbladder. No gallbladder wall
thickening. No biliary ductal dilatation or choledocholithiasis
evident. There is a choledochojejunostomy, which is normal in
appearance.

Within the inferior aspect of the spleen, there is a large
hypodense lesion, without enhancement measuring 4.4 x 4.3 x 3.9
cm that has significantly increased since the [**5-7**] study. There
is an adjacent smaller similar- appearing lesion lateral to this
larger lesion. These are nonspecific but considerations would
include a splenic infarct. There is no stranding around these
lesions, however infection of the lesions cannot be excluded.
Small splenic hemangioma is also again noted unchanged.

The pancreas is normal in appearance. The patient has undergone
gastric bypass with a gastrojejunostomy. Adrenal glands are
normal in appearance. No bowel wall thickening. No evidence of
bowel wall thickening or bowel obstruction. The appendix
contains contrast within it and gas, possibly from prior CT
scan. No evidence for appendicitis. Small amount of fluid within
the right lower quadrant is nonspecific.

The kidneys show heterogeneous hypoenhancement symmetrically in
a patchy geographic pattern in some locations. These areas have
heterogeneous enhancement still on nephrographic phase. There is
no persistent staining on the delayed images, nor is there
contrast within the kidneys on the pre- contrast CT remaining
from [**2106-2-11**] angiogram. These findings are nonspecific but
considerations would include embolic phenomenon such as
cholesterol or other emboli. Of note, there is a large calcified
plaque within the right renal artery just beyond its origin with
at least moderate narrowing of the right renal artery. There is
also moderate narrowing of the left renal artery at its origin.
There are multiple cysts within the kidneys bilaterally. There
are multiple hypoattenuating lesions which are too small to
characterize but likely cysts.

No lymphadenopathy or ascites.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:
The urinary bladder has a Foley catheter within it and is
incompletely distended. No definite urinary bladder abnormality.
There is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis. Bowel
within the pelvis is within normal limits. There is a rectal
tube with balloon inflated within the rectum. Subsequent
administration of rectal contrast shows no leakage of contrast
and no other abnormality. No lymphadenopathy.

CT ARTERIOGRAM WITH IV CONTRAST:
There is diffuse atherosclerotic plaque within the aorta with a
large amount of plaque within the infrarenal aorta. There is an
ulcerated plaque within the infrarenal aorta with a small neck.
This does not extend beyond the normal contour of the aorta. The
left common iliac artery is occluded, as before. There is
reconstitution of the left external iliac artery from retrograde
flow and there is minimal flow within the left internal iliac
artery. The right common iliac artery is patent at its origin
and then there is a bypass graft from the right common iliac
artery to the right common femoral artery. Native right common
iliac artery distally and the external iliac artery is occluded
with an old stent in place. The iliac-femoral graft is widely
patent. Just distal to its insertion within the right common
femoral artery, there is a right to left femoral-femoral bypass
graft which is widely patent. This is just superior to an
excluded partially thrombosed old femoral- femoral bypass graft
which contains gas within it, likely from recent surgery.
Bilateral superficial femoral arteries are patent proximally
though diminutive. There are small fluid collections about
bilateral common femoral arteries near the graft
origin/insertions, both of which contain small amounts of gas,
likely related to recent surgery. Just distal to the insertion
site of the femoral-femoral bypass graft on the left is a round
fluid collection that on pre-contrast images is heterogeneous in
density and post-contrast images shows a small amount of
contrast outside the lumen of the adjacent arteries with
progressive increased density dependently within the collection
seen, making this highly suspicious for a pseudoaneurysm. This
is best demonstrated on series 2, 3, and 4, images 90-94 and
series 6 B, images 186-189. The arteries distal to the graft
sites are patent within the visualized portions.

SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**], and celiac artery are all patent and without evidence
of proximal stenoses. As mentioned above, the right renal artery
has a large calcified plaque just beyond its origin with at
least moderate stenosis. The left renal artery has moderate
stenosis at its origin.

BONE WINDOWS: There is multilevel lumbar disc degeneration. No
suspicious bone lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Aortic atherosclerosis with ulcerated plaque in the
infrarenal aorta. Occluded left common iliac artery with
external iliac artery reconstitution from retrograde flow from
fem-fem bypass graft. Patent right common iliac- femoral bypass
graft and right to left femoral-femoral bypass graft with patent
superficial femoral artery distal to the bypass grafts in the
visualized portions.

2. Just distal to the left insertion of the fem-fem bypass graft
with findings are highly suspicious for a pseudoaneurysm.
[**Female First Name (un) **] ultrasound of this area is recommended to further
evaluate.

3. Gas and fluid about the bilateral femoral [**Female First Name (un) 1106**] operative
sites and gas within the old thrombosed fem-fem bypass graft
likely related to surgery.

4. Increased size of hypodense splenic lesions that could
represent infarcts. No secondary signs of infection, however
this cannot be excluded.

5. Patent SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] without evidence of bowel abnormality.

6. Bilateral patchy heterogeneous perfusion abnormalities within
the kidneys suggesting recent bilateral renal insult, possibly
from embolic phenomenon such as cholesterol emboli. There is
also bilateral renal artery stenosis, slightly worse on the
right than the left, at least a moderate degree.

7. Bilateral pulmonary small airways disease, worse in the bases
than in [**2105-5-3**]. If clinically indicated, high resolution chest
CT could be performed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted and started on anti-coagulation secondary
to LE graft coagulopathy.  Patient was started on a heparin gtt
with goal of 60-80.  Patients Coumadin was initially held.
Patient had groin exploration/angiogram.  Patient was given an
epidural.  Patient tolerated procedure and in PACU area it was
noticed that Hct levels had come down.  Patient was transfused 2
units.  Patient's anticoags were held while he got his
transfusion and then was re-started.  Heme was consulted for
this and suggested HIT.  Patient most-likely was sub-therapeutic
on lovenox.  Typical dosing for Lovenox is 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] and he was
only on 30mg/day.  Patient was admitted to SICU.   Patient was
continued on broad spctrum
antibiotics(Vanco/Clinda/Ceftaz/Flagyl).  Patient's groin
dressings were continually monitored during this time while in
the unit where it was noticed to be draining.  Patient was
screened for HIT and started on Argatroban.  Patients Argatroban
was started/stopped [**Hospital 58097**] hospital stay.  Patients
epidural and NG-tube were DC's post-op day 4 and Clinda was DC'd
as per IS requests.  Patient transferred to VICU and Argatroban
and Coumadin were re-started.  Through-out the patients entire
hospital stay the goal was to acquire a therapeutic state
between (2.0-3.0)  Patient was started on Lovenox sq on final
hospital day and it was explained to patient that when he get's
discharged from hospital he won't be able to check his lovenox
levels.  It was suggested to patient that he stay in the
hospital until his PT becomes therapeutic but the patient
requested he leave and go home on Lovenox sub-q.  Patient was
instructed to f/u w/ PCP(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5456**] qod for coag checks.
Patient wwas also Dc'd on Coumadin 3mg hs, ASA 81mg qd.  Patient
was also given Abx- (Levo/Flagyl).

Facility:
South Eastern [**State 350**] VNA

Discharge Diagnosis:
Thrombosed femoral-femoral graft and iliofemoral graft with
bilateral extremity ischemia.

Hypercoagulable state.


Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
Please restart your home medications.  You may shower regularly,
but no tub baths.  Pat your incisions dry.  If there continues
to be drainage from your incision, place dry gauze over it.
Call a physician or go to the emergency room if you experience
fever >101.4F, pain unrelieved by medication, or foul-smelling
drainage coming from your incision.

Discharge Instructions:

You are to be discharged on coumadin. You must have your INR
followed. This measures the level of coumadin in the blood. This

level must be between [**2-5**]. Your PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] been [**Name (NI) 653**]. [**Name2 (NI) **] will
follow your INR.

You are also on Lovenox this is again a blood thinner, You must
give yourself shots twice a day. You are to take Lovenox untill
the Coumadin (INR ) is between [**2-5**]. When your coumadin level is
appropriate. You may stop the Lovenox.

WOUND CARE:

PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:

Redness in or drainage from your wound(s).

New pain, numbness or discoloration of your lower or upper
extremities (notably on the side of the incision).

Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever
greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus
draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these
or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.



OTHER INFORMATION:

You may shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. A
dressing may cover you??????re wound / incision site and this should
be left in place for three (3) days. Remove it after this time
and wash your incision(s) gently with soap and water. You will
have sutures, which are usually removed in 4 weeks. This will be
done by the Surgeon on your follow-up appointment.

Sutures / Staples may be removed before discharge. If they are
not, an appointment will be made for you to return for
removal.).

When the sutures / staples are removed the doctor may or may not
place pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision.
These will stay on about a week and you may shower with them on.
If these do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off
with warm water and soap in the shower.

Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for
two weeks after surgery.

You may shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. A
dressing may cover you??????re wound / incision site and this should
be left in place for three (3) days. Remove it after this time
and wash your incision(s) gently with soap and water. You may
have staples and or sutures, which are usually removed in 4
weeks. This will be done by the Surgeon on your follow-up
appointment.

Limit strenuous activity  and or heavy lifting until the wound
is well healed. Activity may prevent the wound from healing.

Do not drive a car unless cleared by your Surgeon.

Try to keep your affected limb elevated when not in use, This
decreases swelling to the affected wound and helps in the
healing process.

You may have an ace wrap around the affected limb with the
wound. This helps prevent swelling to the area. You may take
this off at night. But when you are doing activity the ace wrap
should be worn.

ANTIBIOTICS:

You may have a prescription for antibiotics. Take as directed.
Be sure you take the full course even if the wound looks well
healed. Failure to do so may lead to infection.
