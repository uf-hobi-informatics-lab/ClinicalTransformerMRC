History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 49249**] is a 54 year old gentleman with HTN, DM2, CKD
(baseline Cr 2.0-2.2), CAD s/p CABG [**2186**], as well as systolic
and diastolic heart failure (EF had been as low as 20% but last
known to be 40%), who was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**]
Cardiology service from clinic on [**2195-10-16**] for worsening dyspnea
over 2 weeks. CHF exacerbation was in the setting of new
inferior HK and he was diuresed with hopes of pursuing RHC/LHC.
Hospital course was complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] (Cr>3.0), PIV-associated
MSSA bacteremia (did not want [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] dc'ed on IV nafcillin x4
weeks). RHC was done and showed elevated filling pressures, so
he was transferred to the CCU for Milrinone to assist with Lasix
gtt. Due to infection, he was only on milrinone for a few hours.
He was transferred back to the floor and was diuresed well prior
to discharge. He followed up in clinic on [**2195-10-27**] and was found
to have creatinine elevated to 5.4 despite holding torsemide on
[**10-22**] (took it [**10-27**]). He was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for
management of his [**Last Name (un) **].
On interview this afternoon, he denies SOB at rest. He hasn't
been walking much, but doesn't feel "crushing fatigue" now like
he did before. He has been sitting to sleep, which he does think
is worse than when he was admitted. His itchiness continues, but
isn't worse than when in the hospital. He does endorse nausea,
diarrhea (8 loose stools a day) which he reports started with
the nafcillin. Denies fever, chills, abd pain. He reports "I
don't do well with IVs. They always increase my creatinine
regardless of what it is." He has been following the same diet
and eating light. He reports poor intake of fluid as he's trying
to avoid drinking a lot, "much less than 1L a day." His right
eye seems like it has a swollen eyelid today, but he hasn't
noticed. His wife reports that it always looks like this. No
headache.
Reports we weighed 219 today (recorded as 219.2), 215 yesterday,
211 on discharge.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. +Orthopnea, +PND

Imaging:
[**11-11**] Echo
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-11-9**],
left ventricular cavity size is smaller and overall ejection
fraction has increased.

[**2195-11-9**] Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-10-29**],
biventricular systolic function has decreased.

[**2195-11-2**] Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Right heart catheterization revealed severely elevated right
and left
sided filling pressures.  The mean RA pressure was severely
elevated at
18 mmHg, and the RVEDP was severely elevated at 22 mmHg.  There
was
severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of
80/33 mmHg
and a mean PA pressure of 49 mmHg.  The mean wedge pressure was
severely
elevated at 32 mmHg.  The cardiac output and index were reduced
at 4.3
L/min and 2.0 L/min/m2.  The pulmonary vascular resistance was
moderately elevated at 316 dyne-sec/cm5.
2. Ultrasound of the right internal juggular vein suggested
thrombus
which is possibly related to the patient's right sided PICC
line,
however subsequent imaging indicated no thrombus but RIJ very
medially
displaced.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
2. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
3. Reduced cardiac output/index.
4. Moderately elevated PVR.
5. Possible thrombus in the right internal jugular vein which
was not
confirmed by subsequent studies which showed RIJ very medially
displaced.

[**2195-11-13**] CXR
Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer
defibrillator leads
are in standard positions.  Yesterday's mild pulmonary edema has
resolved.
There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion or mediastinal
widening.  Heart is
top normal size, unchanged over the long term.  Also unchanged
since at least
[**10-19**] are fractures of the two uppermost sternal wires,
which
developed sometime after [**2186-4-26**] when non-fusion of the
manubrium was
already evident radiographically.

[**11-12**] CXR
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**11-5**], there has been
placement of an
ICD device with the leads in the region of the right atrium and
apex of the
right ventricle.  Specifically, there is no evidence of
pneumothorax.  Little
change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.



Persistent separation of the upper sternal fragments therefore
does not
suggest infection, but it is an explanation for fracture of the
wires

[**10-28**] CXR
REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with systolic
and diastolic
heart failure.

PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in
comparison to
[**2195-10-23**].

Heart size is enlarged in a globular manner, unchanged.
Mediastinum is
stable.  Multiple broken sternal wires are redemonstrated.

As compared to the prior study, there is interval improvement in
interstitial
pulmonary edema, currently mild.  There is also improvement in
more focal
right upper lobe opacity.  Prominence of pulmonary arteries is
demonstrated,
most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension.  No
appreciable pleural
effusion is seen.

[**2195-10-28**] RENAL U/S
IMPRESSION:  No hydronephrosis seen in either kidney.  Small
right renal
nonobstructing stone.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
Mr. [**Known lastname 49249**] is a 54y/o gentleman with HTN, HLD, DM2, CKD
(baseline Cr 2.0-2.2), CAD s/p CABG [**2186**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, and
radial-OM1-OM2) with systolic and diastolic heart failure, who
was re-admitted from clinic for management of [**Last Name (un) **].

#. Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr 2.1, presented
last admission at 2.5, and presented at this admission with
creatinine 5.4 in clinic. His renal function fluctuated, and he
was initially managed with 40mg [**Hospital1 **] torsemide. However, he did
not respond well and had worsening renal function. Accordingly,
he underwent R heart cath, which showed severely elevated right
and left sided filling pressures, severe pulmonary hypertension
and depressed CO/CI. He was admitted to the CCU for milrinone
drip and more aggressive diuresis.
On admission, urine studies suggested pre-renal cause of [**Last Name (un) **]
(FEurea 44% is indeterminate, FENa 0.86%).  Torsemide had been
held between hospital admissions. Nephrology was consulted and
recommended cefazolin to substitute for Nafcillin (though due to
the short time period, they did not believe [**Last Name (un) **] was consistent
with nafcillin-associated acute interstitial nephritis and urine
eosinophils were positive. Sarna lotion and hydroxyzine were
given for symptomatic relief of uremia-related pruritus. Pt's Cr
trended down to mid 3s, plateaued and then steadily rised. After
pt was switched from milrinone drip to dobutamine drip as well
as optimized afterload reduction with hydralazine and Isordil,
Cr consistently trended down. Upon discharge, Cr was 3.3.
.
#. Acute on chronic CHF: Due to continued weight gain and poor
response, he underwent a R heart cath [see above]. Pt's beta
blocker was restarted at a low dose and then later on
discontinued as pt was in decompensated HF and later on put on
dobutamine drip. Afterload reduction was successful while up
titrating hydralazine and Isordil. Upon discharge, pt's BP was
ranging 130-140. Heart failure team believed CHF is both related
to significant dyssynchrony and contractility issues, both most
likely related to ischemia. Pt was diuresed aggressively
throughout course initially with Lasix drip and then
transitioned to IV Lasix boluses with goal of [**3-12**].5L negative in
24h using 120mg boluses. Pt was transitioned to 100mg Torsemide
at discharge. Dyssynchrony component of HF was addressed with
attempting to place CRT-D. Unfortunately, coronary sinus could
not be accessed successfully and thus LV lead was not placed.
Contractility was addressed with dobutamine drip which pt was
discharged with. After starting dobutamine infusion, EF improved
from 20 to 30% on TTE. Pt will need to followup with EP in order
to access LV for appropriate resynchronization and will probably
have a cardiac catheterization to assess coronaries.
.
#. Peripheral IV-associated MSSA bacteremia:
- Changed nafcillin to cefazolin per ID recs; he underwent a [**Date Range **]
this admission, which did not show any valvular vegetations. As
a result, he underwent a shortened course of IV antibiotics (2
weeks), which ended on [**2195-11-2**]. Pt remained afebrile and stable
thereafter.
.
#. Loose stools
- Recent hospital stay could raise concern for C. diff (pt
nauseous, but no f/c). Per patient, he feels that loose stools
began w/ nafcillin. Either way, may contribute to pre-renal
cause of [**Last Name (un) **] (along with recent poor intake). Loose stools
resolved after stopping nafcillin. In addition, he was c. diff
negative.
.
.
#. CAD s/p CABG
Last cath in [**2191**] noted severe native 3VD with patent LIMA-LAD,

SVG-PDA, and Radial-OM1-OM2. TTE on prior showed new inferior
HK. He was continued on ASA, Pravastatin, and beta blocker
(Metoprolol changed to Carvedilol). In the future he needs L
heart catheterization in order to assess grafts/native vessels.
Pt was continued on ASA and statin. Carvedilol was ultimately
held given decompensated heart failure and pt put on dobutamine
infusion.
.
#. Neuropathic & venous stasis ulcers: Pt was seen by wound care
specialist during hospitalization. Ulcers appeared to heal more
optimally when LE edema decreased with aggressive diuresis. Pt
is to followup with PCP to continue DM management and may need
referral to vascular surgery if ulcers persist or worsen.
.
#. Diabetes mellitus: Stable on ISS, and discharged with Lantus
44u at bedtime with ISS.
.
# Iron deficiency anemia: Hct stable during last admission
30-33. Iron studies showed low level of iron and pt was given 5
days of ferric gluconate IV 125mg to replete iron deficit. Pt's
anemia was stable thereafter and discharged with hct of 28.1.

#Elevated INR: Pt's INR was elevated over 2 during hospital
course without anticoagulation. This was attributed to Vitamin K
deficiency secondary to antibiotic use, malnutrition and
malabsorption from congested bowels related to decompensated
CHF. DIC labs were not remarkable. Pt's elevated INR was
refractory to PO Vit K which supported hypothesis of congestion
in GI tract causing malabsorption issues. As pt's nutrition
improved and preload reduction, INR trended down to 1.4 at time
of discharge. Pt was followed by nutrition during stay and would
benefit from outpt nutrition management.
.
>> TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- follow up with EP regarding CRT lead placement into LV
- could benefit from ACEI once kidney function improves
- readdress restarting carvedilol when HF better controlled off
of dobutamine
- f/u with PCP regarding lower extremity wounds, medication
reconciliation and diabetes management
- would benefit from outpt nutritional support (fluid
restriction, diabetes)
- would benefit from cardiac cath once kidney function stable
and adequate to assess coronaries/ischemic disease related to
heart failure
- f/u with cardiology

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 49249**],

You were first readmitted to [**Hospital1 1170**] for worsened kidney function as well as worsening
symptoms of heart failure.

You were then tranferred to the CCU because you required
medications to help your heart pump. You were first started on
milrinone with minimal improvement and were then started on
dobutamine.  You will go home on a continuous infusion of
dobutamine. It is very important for you to follow up closely
with your doctors and to take your medications as prescribed.

While you were here we tried to place a CRT device, however
there was difficulty placing one of the leads. You now have an
ICD. You will need a different procedure in the future to place
an additional lead on your heart for cardiac resynchronization.
You will also need a cardiac catheterization as an outpatient.

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.

It was a pleasure caring for you,
Your [**Hospital1 18**] doctors
