Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization, mechanical intubation, continuous
[**Last Name (un) **]-venous hemofiltration

History of Present Illness:
85 year old woman with hx of CAD s/p prior PTCA, pVD, DM2, htn,
chol and anemia presented to NWH on [**2167-4-8**] with unstable
angina. Her EKG was described as unchanged from prior. Her labs
were notable for Trop0.06. BNP 234. creat 1.3 on arrival
(baseline 1.2).
Her evaluation there was notable for cardiac enzymes as above.
She was felt to be in mild congestive heart failure after 1 unit
of pRBCS which she received for a Hct of 26. She received 2
doses of lasix. She was started on a heparin gtt (not listed in
discharge meds. She did have small amount of blood on her toilet
tissue thought secondary to hemorrhoidal bleed. She did receive
a 2nd unit of PRBCs. A TTE (prelim only) LAE, preserved LVEF,
mild MR/TR.
.
She describes her baseline at chronic stable angina with chest
pressure at similar level of exertion such as walking [**5-17**] block
of level ground. However over the past month she noted a
decreased threshhold for her discomfort now after only 1 flight
of stairs. On the day prior to her admission she had the similar
sensation of chest pressure while at rest. It lasted for ~2
hours and improved with nitroglycerin. She had recurrent event
at 1:30pm on the 25th so she presented to the hospital. She
states her weight has been stable. She has chronic venous stasis
and has had new lower extremity swelling over the past few
weeks. She has no orthopnea or PND.

.
On floor, patient was feeling short of breath with walking to
the bathroom but otherwise feeling well. She has no current
chest pain.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools. She has been having small amount of blood on the toilet
tissue over the past few weeks. She denies recent fevers, chills
or rigors. She has exertional leg pain at 4 blocks of walking.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

STUDIES OF RELEVANCE IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER:

[**2167-4-9**] CXR:
Lungs clear, mild pulmonary engorgement and top normal heart
size suggest
borderline cardiac decompensation, but there is no edema or
appreciable
pleural effusion.

[**2167-4-10**] Card Cath:
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed:

--the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the LAD had a proximal <50% stenosis.
--the LCX had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the RCA had an ostial >90% stenosis.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated
left-sided
filling pressures, with LVEDP 30 mmHg.  There was mild systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension with SBP 149 mmHg.  There was no gradient
across
the aortic valve upon pullback of the angled pigtail catheter
from LV to
ascending aorta.
3.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with two
overlapping
bare metal stents - Minivision (2.5x15mm distally; 2.5x12mm
proximally)
postdilated with a 2.75mm balloon. Final angiography
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and
TIMI III
flow throughout the vesel (See PTCA comments).
4.  Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with a 6F
Angioseal closure device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Significant one coronary artery disease.
2.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with two
overlapping
bare metal stents.
3.  Successful clousre of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with a 6F
Angioseal closure device.

[**2167-4-11**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mild basal and mid-anterior septal
hypokinesis, distal septal akinesis and probable apical
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
40-45%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericar
dial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal right ventricular systolic function. Mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

[**2167-4-11**]:
IMPRESSION: CT A and P
1. Multifocal consolidations may represent pneumonia, however
pulmonary
hemorrhage in the setting of hyperdense, and likely hemorrhagic,
effusions
should be considered.
2. Retained renal contrast with vicarious excretion via the
gallbladder, all
consistent with renal failure.
3. Fibroid uterus.

[**2167-4-13**] CT Chest:
Followup of a patient with bilateral pleural
effusion, consolidations, and known pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen from [**2167-4-11**] and multiple chest
radiographs
obtained in the interval between [**4-9**] and [**2167-4-13**].

TECHNIQUE: Unenhanced MDCT of the chest was obtained from
thoracic inlet to upper abdomen with subsequent 1.25- and 5-mm
collimation axial images reviewed in conjunction with coronal
and sagittal reformats.

FINDINGS:
Extensive widespread consolidations involve mostly the right
upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe but also are
seen in left lower lobe and left apex. The consolidations are
relatively high in density (the left upper lobe consolidation is
about 57 Hounsfield units in density), as are the right middle
lobe and lower lobe consolidations (ranging up to 50 Hounsfield
units). The comparison of the lung bases with a recent CT
abdomen from [**2167-4-3**] demonstrates interval progression
of the consolidations in the right middle and right lower lobe.
The bilateral pleural effusion, although did not increase
significantly in size, is still of high density (up to 46
Hounsfield units) in the lower portions of the lungs suggesting
sedimentation effect.

The mediastinal lymph nodes are enlarged ranging up to 16 mm in
right lower paratracheal area and might be reactive. Extensive
coronary calcifications are noted. The heart size is mildly
enlarged. There is no significant pericardial effusion.

Minimal left pneumothorax is demonstrated, 2A:31, seen in the
anterior
mediastinum giving the patient's supine position and might
correspond to an apical pneumothorax demonstrated on the upright
chest radiograph obtained the same day earlier at 09:09 a.m.
Although the comparison between the chest CT and chest
radiograph is difficult, the size of the pneumothorax is most
likely unchanged and is small.

The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates fat density
left adrenal lesion, -19 Hounsfield units, consistent with
lipoma. The rest is
unremarkable within the limitations of this non-enhanced study.
Again note is made of the presence of contrast enhancement of
the kidneys consistent with known failure and retained excretion
of contrast. Contrast is also
demonstrated in the renal pelvis. The vicarious excretion of the
distended
gallbladder is again noted. The bladder is at least 5 cm in
diameter,
although no wall thickening or surrounding abnormalities are
seen.

There are no [**Year (4 digits) 500**] lesions worrisome for malignancy. Degenerative
changes are seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive bilateral consolidations, right more than left, of
high density that might be consistent with multifocal
hemorrhage. The differential diagnosis in the presence of renal
failure might include vasculitis. Hemorrhagic pneumonia might be
considered in appropriate clinical setup.
2. Small left apical pneumothorax, most likely unchanged
compared to prior
chest radiograph.
3. Bilateral grossly unchanged pleural effusions, high in
density that might also contain an element of hemorrhage.
4. Extensive coronary calcifications.
5. Still present contrast enhancement of kidneys and vicarious
excretion of contrast the gallbladder consistent with known
renal failure.




Brief Hospital Course:
85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease s/p
BMS x 2 in RCA on [**2167-4-10**], with post-cath course complicated by
pulmonary edema, contrast-induced nephropathy requiring CCU stay
with transition to cardiac service.

1) Unstable angina/CAD: Patient's typical anginal pain was
occurring at rest and had ST depressions in V4-6. Given concern
for ongoing bleeding cath was deferred until [**4-10**]. Cardiac
catheterization demonstrated 90% occlusion of ostial RCA which
was stented with two overlapping bare metal stents. Her chest
pain occurred intermittently since the PCI with intermittent ST
depressions in V4-V6. Nitro gtt was temporarily started for the
pain, and she remained pain free after it was discontinued.
Cardiac markers were mildly elevated, likely demand ischemia
from anemia, and CK-MB was negative. She was treated with
aspirin, statin, and plavix. Patient's metoprolol was restarted
once she stabilized.

2) Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Felt to be
secondary to RBC transfusions at OSH. She had an ongoing O2
requirement and desatted to 85% RA on am of [**4-11**], for which she
was transferred to the CCU and lasix gtt was started. Fluid was
initially removed via CVVH (as below), although once UOP
improved, she was successfully diuresed with IV furosemide.

3) Acute on chronic CKD: FENa 6%, likely contrast nephropathy.
Her [**Last Name (un) **] was held. Renal was consulted for poor UOP while on
lasix drip and high dose diuril. Her creatinine rose and she was
started on CVVH via L IJ line. After a few days, her UOP picked
up and responded well to 40mg IV furosemide boluses, so the CVVH
line was removed.

4) Anemia: Given concern for RP bleed related to cath, she had
CT abd, which showed bilat ?hemothoraces, but no RP bleed. Other
source could be GI bleed from external hemorrhoids. She received
1 unit of pRBCs and her hematocrit remained stable.

5) Pneumonia: Patient had frequent coughing associated with
desaturations. CT chest was concerning for atypical pneumonia
vs. alveolar hemorrhage, although pulm consult favored the
former. ANCA and anti-GBM were negative. She received a 5 day
course of azithromycin and a brief course of prednisone for
possible diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (one day each at 60mg,
40mg, 20mg, 10mg). Her cough greatly improved.

6) Diabetes mellitus: Initially on glargine, although changed to
insulin gtt in the CCU due to highly elevated (300s) sugars in
the setting of steroids. She was transitioned back to glargine
as the steroids were rapidly tapered.
