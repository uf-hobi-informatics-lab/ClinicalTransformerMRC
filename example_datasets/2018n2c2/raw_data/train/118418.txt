Admission Date: [**2178-1-20**]        Discharge Date: [**2178-2-7**]

Date of Birth:  [**2107-2-15**]        Sex:  M

Service:  OME


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 70-year-old
male with extensive locally recurrent melanoma involving his
face, status post excision, neck dissection and radiation
therapy.  Initial staging was consistent with stage III C
disease but now with mets to the lung, bone and soft tissue.
He was due to be started on high-dose IL-2 but in clinic on
[**2178-1-12**], he was noticed to have erythema in an area of
recent lymph node dissection felt consistent with cellulitis,
and was started on oral Keflex, and now is presenting with
worsening erythema.  The patient reports that in the week
since he started antibiotics, the erythema has enlarged and
become more red.  In clinic today, his white blood cell count
was up to 20,000 and he was admitted to OMED service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, metastatic melanoma with
original diagnosis in [**2177-6-5**].  On [**2177-8-21**] he underwent
wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy, with
melanoma present in 1 left intraparotid node.  On [**2177-8-28**]
he had re-excision of the left temple and cheek area and a
left radical neck dissection, with melanoma in 7 of 69 total
lymph nodes.  He underwent radiation therapy to the forehead
area, completing 20 fractions over 4 weeks.  He then
developed soft tissue nodule superior to the graft, that
might have represented residual melanoma and appeared to have
reduced in size with radiation.

In late [**2177-10-6**] a PET CT showed increased glucose
uptake at sites of surgery on his thigh and around the
superior edge of the graft on his face.  He was seen in
follow-up one of three weeks after completion of radiation.
Follow up head MRI and torso CT on [**2178-1-7**] revealed no
metastatic brain lesions, but metastatic disease in his
chest, left axilla, mediastinum and lung, as well as a T12
sclerotic focus felt consistent with melanoma.  The BRCA
mutation testing on his tumor was negative.  He has passed
screening tests to begin high-dose IL-2 therapy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Enalapril 20 mg p.o. daily,
pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily, Keflex 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Reveals an elderly male
in no apparent distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round,
reactive to light.  Left temporal and buccal graft without
erythema.  NECK:  Well-healed scar from posterior auricular
area to the left upper chest.  No signs of wound dehiscence.
Broad area of erythema and corresponding area warm to touch.
No palpable masses or fluid collections.  No cervical,
supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy.  HEART:  Regular
rate and rhythm, S1, S2.  CHEST:  No dullness to percussion
and clear to auscultation bilaterally.  ABDOMEN:  Positive
bowel sounds, soft, nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Warm and well
perfused, 1+ edema to [**12-8**] the way up shins bilaterally, 2+ DP
and PT pulses.  NEUROLOGIC EXAM:  Nonfocal.

ADMISSION LABS:  WBC 20.9, hemoglobin 11.7, hematocrit 33.7,
platelet count 206,000, BUN 20, creatinine 1.2, sodium 134,
potassium 6.1, chloride 101, CO2 23, glucose 117.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with cellulitis
and was placed on IV vancomycin.  Doxycycline was added when
he did not appear to be improving.  Unasyn was added when the
cellulitic area continued to worsen.  He also became short of
breath and was treated with Lasix.  Transthoracic echo
revealed diastolic heart failure and he was continued on
enalapril and Lasix.  He had an ID consult on [**1-28**] who
suggested stopping the Unasyn, changing to cefepime and
adding vancomycin back.  Blood cultures remained negative and
he was afebrile throughout this time.  Derm consult on [**1-28**]
was obtained due to persistent rash, and a biopsy was
performed consistent with melanoma.  He was subsequently
transferred to the biologic service on [**2178-1-30**] to begin
high-dose IL-2 therapy.

During this week he received 7 of 14 doses with 7 doses held
related to tachycardia and pulmonary edema.  On treatment day
#4, he was tachypneic with hypoxia to the mid 80s.  Chest x-
ray was consistent with bilateral pleural effusions.
Throughout the day he became increasingly more tachypneic and
fatigued, and was transferred to the ICU.  He was treated
with Lasix with improvement in his respiratory status.  An
echocardiogram on [**2178-2-3**] showed a small pericardial
effusion with question tamponade physiology.  Cardiology was
consulted and felt they were not able to tap the effusion.
He underwent a cardiac MRI on [**2178-2-4**] revealing no cardiac
metastases and no tamponade physiology.

He developed SVT to the 140s on [**2178-2-4**], which
spontaneously improved with a fluid bolus.  His respiratory
status improved with continued diuresis, and he was
transferred back to the floor on [**2178-2-5**].  Lasix and
enalapril were continued and he was weaned to room air with
O2 saturations in the mid 90s.

Physical therapy consult was initiated and he was ambulating
short distances with a steady gait.  He was discharged to
home on [**2178-2-7**] with a plan to follow up in clinic on
[**2178-2-10**].

Other side effects related to IL-2 included rigors improved
with Demerol; fatigue; and hypotension on treatment day 3,
requiring fluid boluses.  During this week he developed acute
renal failure with a peak creatinine of 3.0 with associated
oliguria.  He developed metabolic acidosis with a minimum
bicarb of 18, improved with bicarbonate boluses.
Electrolytes were monitored and repleted per protocol.
Strict I & Os and serum chemistries were maintained.  IV
fluids were continued given acute renal failure.

During this week he had mild ST elevation to 54, which
improved prior to discharge.  He had no hyperbilirubinemia,
myocarditis or coagulopathy noted.  He was thrombocytopenic
to a platelet count low of 68,000 without evidence of
bleeding.  He was anemic and was transfused with packed red
blood cells with discharge hemoglobin of 9.1.  By [**2178-2-7**]
he had recovered from side effects to allow for discharge to
home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Alert, oriented and ambulatory.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with his family.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Metastatic melanoma status post cycle 1, week 1, high-
    dose IL-2 therapy complicated by pulmonary edema, and
    bilateral pleural effusions from IL-2 induced capillary
    leak, with respiratory distress.
2. Acute renal failure related to IL-2 therapy.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Enalapril 20 mg p.o. daily, Lasix 20
mg p.o. daily, lorazepam 0.5 mg q. 6 hours p.r.n. nausea,
pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily, Compazine 5 to 10 mg q.i.d.
p.r.n. nausea.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient will return to clinic on
[**2178-2-10**] for assessment of his clinical status prior to
consideration for treatment with week #2 of therapy.
