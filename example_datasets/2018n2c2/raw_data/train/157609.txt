Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal extubation

History of Present Illness:
*Per OSH records as patient could not provide limited history
while intubated and sedated*
41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (s/p admission at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**])
who was transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] following episode
of altered mental status early today that led to intubation for
airway protection. Patient had a head CT performed at [**Hospital 40796**] which was reported as showing right temporal and
parietal edema and small foci of hemorrhage, though the images
were not sent with the patient upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. According
to discharge paperwork from [**Hospital3 **] today, the patient
originally presented to the hospital on [**2144-12-21**] with
intractable nausea and vomiting of 5 days duration. While at
[**Hospital3 **], the patient had several abdominal films as well as
an upper GI series which were reportedly unremarkable.
Physicians were concerned that there was a central cause of
nausea and attempted head imaging, which the patient initially
refused. Late on night of [**2144-10-23**], patient was found to be
minimally responsive with head turning to right and arms flexed
to chest. As he had received nortriptyline, there was initial
concern for a dystonic reaction and 50 mg IV diphenhydramine was
pushed. There was no improvement in his mental status following
that intervention and he was intubated for ariway protection and
head CT was then performed with results as above. Transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] was requested given patient's decline in mental status
requiring intubation.

Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital6 5016**]
on [**12-14**] with hypercalcemia and a pseudomonas infection of stage
IV pressure ulcer. He completed antibiotic course of
ceftazidime, daptomycin, and azithromycin.

Unknown level of ambulation immediately prior to presentation to
[**Hospital6 5016**] on [**2144-12-21**]; however, at time of discharge
from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2144-11-12**], he could stand and walk about 10 feet.
A recent neurology note from [**2144-12-4**] assessed his IP strength
as being 1 on the right and 0 on the left. He was assessed as
having "residual severe paraparesis due to combination of
deconditioning and vincristine toxic polyneuropathy, and
question of critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy."

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:

CT head [**12-24**]
1. Limited study due to patient motion despite five repeat
attempts.
2. Round mild densities in the temporal lobes, and possibly
increased density interdigitating with the sulci. Note
additional history obtained of Burkitt's lymphoma. The findings
may relate to lymphoma involvement, less likely parenchymal and
subarachnoid hemorrhage, though not quite as dense as typical
hemorrhage products, especially in temporal lobes.
3. Enlarged pituitary gland, better evaluated on recent MR
pituitary.
These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4011**] at 9:00 p.m.
[**2144-12-24**], at which time MRI had been ordered and the patient had
been brought for MRI.

[**12-25**] MRI, MRV, MRA head
1. Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and FLAIR hyperintensity
involving the right greater than left temporal and parietal
lobes, with more focal areas of parenchymal abnormality in the
temporal lobe, also right greater than left.  Differential
diagnostic considerations primarily include recurrent lymphoma
(especially given the patient's history of Burkitt's lymphoma)
as well as a meningoencephalitis such as herpes encephalitis,
although other viral or bacterial meningoencephalitides could
also result in a similar appearance.

2. Areas of decreased diffusion corresponding to the
leptomeningeal disease with additional foci involving the right
thalamus and right hippocampus, which may represent acute
infarcts, although they may be related to lymphomatous
involvement versus infectious process given the findings above.
Hypoxic injury would be a less likely differential
consideration.

3. Suboptimal MRA and MRV given patient motion. There is no
definite
evidence of venous thrombosis, although the sigmoid sinuses and
the visualized internal jugular veins are suboptimally
evaluated.

4. No evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis on the
MRA of the
head, although irregularity at the anterior communicating artery
raises the possibility of a small aneurysm. This was
suboptimally evaluated given the degree of patient motion. At
the time of followup imaging, the MRA sequence could be
repeated.

5. Pituitary adenoma, not significantly changed since the prior
examination when accounting for differences in technique,
although dedicated imaging of the sella was not obtained today.

[**12-25**]
TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is probably mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-8-13**],
the LVEF is less vigorous. The pericardial effusion is slightly
larger but still with no evidence for overt tamponade.

[**12-27**] Chest Xray
The endotracheal tube is no longer visualized. This is a rotated

film. There is bilateral lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis.
The right
Port-A-Cath is unchanged.

[**12-28**] CT Head
Relatively stable vasogenic edema in the temporal lobes as well
as leptomeningeal hyperdensity and hyperdensity in the left
temporal lobe. Question of increased hypodensity in the mid
brain, recommend correlation with MRI to exclude the possibility
of ischemia.

[**12-29**] Chest Xray
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
change. No evidence of pneumothorax, no pleural effusion. Mild
retrocardiac atelectasis. No focal parenchymal opacity
suggesting pneumonia, no overhydration.


Brief Hospital Course:
41 year old gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell
lymphoma (s/p admission at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**])
who was transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] following episode
of altered mental status early on day of admission, [**12-24**], that
led to intubation for airway protection.

#. Lymphoma: He initially presented to [**Hospital6 5016**] with
nausea and vomiting.  On admission here, an LP was done that
showed a high opening pressure (49) and multiple atypical cells
concerning for recurrent CNS lymphoma.  He was started on
high-dose Decadron and was followed by Medical Oncology,
Neuro-oncology, and Radiation Oncology.  His presenting symptoms
were considered a consequence of his worsening lymphoma.  Given
his previous treatments with intrathecal chemotherapy, he was
not considered a candidate for chemotherapy.  He began
palliative full brain XRT on [**2144-12-28**].  His clinical condition
deteriorated and his respiratory status worsened and he was only
able to have one treatment. On [**2144-12-29**] a discussion with the
health care proxy led to Mr. [**Known lastname **] being made comfort measures
only.  He died on [**2144-12-31**] at 4:40pm.

#. Altered mental status:  His AMS was most likely caused by
recurrent CNS lymphoma and increased intracranial pressure.  He
was initially treated with Acyclovir for HSV, however this was
stopped due to low clinical suspicion. His mental status did not
improve off sedation.  His mental status deteriorated to the
point where he was not responsive, likely related to his CNS
lymphoma and increased ICP.

#. Endotracheal intubation/extubation: He was intubated for
airway protection at an OSH prior to admission.  He
self-extubated two days after admission without complication.
He remained off ventilatory support and became hypoxic three
days prior to death but was made comfort measures only.

#. Pneumonia: At admission, he spiked a temperature, had copious
secretions and a consolidation in the RUL on chest x-ray.
Vancomycin and Cefepime were started on [**12-25**] for a planned 8
day course, which was stopped early when the goals of care were
changed.

#. Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma:  He had a history of a
pituitary adenoma and surgical resection had been planned for
future.  This was deferred due to his poor clinical status.

#. Sacral decubitus ulcer:  He had a stage IV sacral ulcer with
recent pseudomonal infection. It appeared uninfected on
admission and was followed by the wound care team.

#. Code Status: He was initially full code during this
hospitalization, but after he clinically worsened with severe
alteration in mental status, he was made DNR/DNI and eventually
comfort measures only.

#. Emergency Contact: [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 40169**] (Health Care Proxy): Primary
ph [**Telephone/Fax (1) 83235**], Secondary ph [**Telephone/Fax (1) 83236**]
