Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5341**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea / Vomiting / Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2172-4-21**]: S/p Left temporal-parietal crani for tumor resection


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 97968**] is a 66 year-old male with a history of lung
cancer, a left internal capsule stroke and left temporal grade
III infiltrating astrocytoma presented to the emergency room
this afternoon with multiple complaints. He is lethargic and
aphasic - history obtained primarily from his daughter who
accompanied him to the emergency room. Briefly he was diagnosed
with two seperate primaries last year (lung adenocarcinoma
treated with a lobectomy and an astrocytoma). He was on high
dose steroid therapy to reduce the cerebral edema and developed
a myopathy which prompted the gradual tapering of his steroids.
He was recently enrolled in the Xerecept clinical trial and his
decadron dose was reduced from 12mg qd down to 6 mg qd. His
daughter notes that since the reduction of the steroids he has
had become increasingly lethargic and fatigued. In addition, she
notes that over the past 24 hours he has had several episodes of
urinary incontinence and emesis. She also notes he has had
increasing difficulty walking and performing his basic tasks.
His daughter reports that he has been drinking but has had a
decreased appetite over the past 48 hours.

Review of Systems: Pt not able to provide. He was recently
diagnosed with a right lower extremity DVT for which he was
started on lovenox therapy. Accoring to his daughter no chest
pain, shortness of breath or syncopal episodes today. She feels
the swelling in the lower leg is mildly improved todya on exam.

ER course - CT of head demonstrated increasing midline shift
leftward from the MRI done in [**2172-2-20**]; worsening edema; mass
effect on left ventricle; displacement of ipsilateral lateral
ventricle although degree of herniation has increased;
progressive left peduncle herniation. Pt discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]
and given dose of Dexadron (10 mg IV).

CT HEAD ([**2172-4-20**]):
1. Worsening vasogenic edema and midline shift (subfalcine
heriation) secondary to large known GBM. There is similar
effacement of the ipsilateral lateral ventrical, although the
degree of subfalcine herniation has increased.
2. There is increased sulcal effacement of the suprasellar
cistern and ambient cisterns on the left, indicating progressive
left uncal herniation with early transtentorial migration.
3. Hypodensity within the left cerebral peduncle, likely
corresponds to signal abnormality noted on MRI from [**2172-3-16**].

MRI BRAIN ([**2172-4-20**]):
New left to right subfalcine and left uncal herniation
associated with a dramatic increase in peritumoral edema
surrounding a left temporal lobe lesion. The lesion itself is
only slightly increased in size. Slow diffusion in small focal
areas in this lesion suggests infarction. However, focal areas
of necrosis may produce this effect. Enhancement and FLAIR
signal hyperintensity along the sulci in the left cerebral
hemisphere are concerning for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.
This finding makes associated radiation necrosis less likely. If
clinically indicated, MR perfusion and Spectroscopy imaging
could be performed.

CTX ([**2172-4-20**]):
Increase in the right pleural effusion and/or adjacent
atelectasis. Otherwise, unchanged appearance of the post-surgery
chest.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Astrocytoma:
The CT of his demonstrated increasing midline shift along with
increasing edema likely accounting for the majority of his
symptoms.  Steroid dose had been tapered recently given the
patient's steroid myopathy.  Given this, he was given 10 mg IV
decadrom in the emergency room with continuation of IV steroids
thereafter.

He was seen by neurosurgery and taken to the OR on [**2172-4-21**] for
left temporal craniotomy for tumor debulking.  There were no
intraoperative or postoperative complications.  The patient was
taken to the trauma ICU overnight for close monitoring of his
neuro status and blood pressure.  PRN hydralazine was used to
keep SBP<140.  A repeat CT showed "interval decompression and
improvement in the amount of mass effect, midline shift,
subfalcine herniation, and effacement of the left suprasellar
and ambient cisterns" and the patient remained without headache
or nausea/vomiting.  His speach aphasic and his right-sided
weakness was stable to mildly improved.  He was seen by physical
and occupational therapy and they felt he would benefit from
rehab.

At the time of discharge, the plan was for:
- Continued dexamethasone, with taper
- Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] on [**5-5**] for chemotherapy
- Monitoring of mental status
- Metoprolol was started for blood pressure control

2. Steroid Myopathy:
Patient had a history of steroid induced myopathy and had
presented with an ongoing steroid taper.  Given the amount of
edema seen and the symptoms secondary to this, steroids were
increased at the time of admission and were continued; upon
discharge, plan was for a steroid taper.  As above, both PT and
OT were consulted.

3. DVT:
Patient had recent history of DVT, diagnosed [**2172-4-14**].  Presented
on daily lovenox, which was held before surgery.
Post-operatively, the lovenox was held for two days and resumed
on discharge.

4. Lung cancer:
Was status-post lobectomry.  This issue was stable during
admission.
