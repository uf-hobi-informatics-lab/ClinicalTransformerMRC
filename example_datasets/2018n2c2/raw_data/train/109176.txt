Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4232**]
Chief Complaint:
neck swelling


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left neck exploration and drain placement
intubation and mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
30F with a history of [**Doctor Last Name 9376**] disease and chronic
pancytopenia/neutropenia who is re-admitted with reaccumulation
of fluid following initial drainage of posterior/parapharyngeal
abscess on [**2124-2-23**].

She initially presented ~3 weeks ago with neck/swallowing pain
and was found to have the above abscess on CT imaging, which was
drained and cultures ultimately grew beta streptococcus group A
and propionobacterium acnes. She was treated with meropenem for
this (changed to ertapenem upon discharge). Her initial
hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 61436**]) was complicated by intubation for
airway protection x several days, neutropenia (WBC nadir 0.6
with 67% neutrophils on [**2-26**]), anemia to Hct < 21 (received 2
units pRBCs). She also developed left IJ nearly-occlusive clot,
which was not felt to be septic in origin. After multispecialist
discussion, the decision was made not to anticoagulate as risks
were felt to outweigh benefits. She was seen by hematology
during that admission and started on Neupogen, which was stopped
when WBC count came > 3500. She had planned follow up as an
outpatient for ? BMBx in early [**Month (only) 116**].

After returning home, she initially stabilized and felt she was
beginning to improve; however, her husband noticed after several
days that she was developing increased swelling at the surgical
site as well as increased drainage. She also had increased pain
and developed nightsweats, though temps were in 99s (no true
fever). She came back to ED where CT scan showed re-accumulation
of fluid, and she was taken back to OR [**2124-3-14**] by ENT for
drainage. She spent the night in SICU for observation, where she
has done well from a surgical perspective (3 drains in place, no
airway compromise).

Currently she has minimal complaints of neck pain well
controlled with dilaudid PCA.  Has no difficulty swallowing,
breathing or speaking.

Imaging:

[**2124-3-14**]   Radiology CT NECK W/CONTRAST:
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired 2.5 mm axial images of the neck were
obtained following the uneventful administration of 70 cc of
Omnipaque intravenous contrast. Coronal, sagittal reformations
were performed at 2 mm slice thickness. FINDINGS: Extensive soft
tissue swelling throughout the superficial and deep spaces of
the left neck and abnormal thickening and enhancement of the
left sternocleidomastoid and posterior cervical muscles are
again seen (2:29). There is increased rim thickening and
enhancement of an organizing fluid collection along the left
neck extending posteriorly (2:33) since [**2124-2-28**], with a
dominant collection measuring 34 x 7 mm (2:28). Previously noted
drains have been removed with subcutaneous gas likely reflecting
packing material within a lateral incision (2:54). No bony
erosions are detected. There is improved retropharyngeal
swelling with decreased mass effect on the neighboring airway,
including slight restoration of the left piriform sinus and
decreased swelling of the left aryepiglottic fold and
epiglottis. The airway remains patent. No new fluid collections
are seen. There is no subcutaneous emphysema. Neighboring great
vessels remain patent, although there is continued marked
narrowing of the left internal jugular vein (2:34) as it passes
through the area of inflammation in the left neck. Included
views of the lung apices demonstrates minimal paraseptal
emphysema (301b:68). The thyroid is normal. IMPRESSION: 1.
Organizing rim-enhancing fluid collection concerning for an
abscess tracking along the left lateral and posterior neck,
overall slightly worsened since [**2124-2-28**], with increased
size of a dominant posterior collection measuring up to 8 mm,
and increased thickeness of an enhancing rind. 2. Improved
retropharyngeal swelling with decreased mass effect on the
neighboring airway, including slight restoration of the left
piriform sinus and decreased swelling of the left aryepiglottic
fold and epiglottis. 3. Removal of surgical drains with
subcutaneous gas in the left neck possibly reflecting packing
material within the surgical incision. 4. Continued severe focal
narrowing the left internal jugular vein as it courses through
the area of inflammation in the left neck.

[**3-25**] Liver U/S:  Normal liver echotexture. No intra- or
extra-hepatic bile duct dilation. The gallbladder is collapsed.

Brief Hospital Course:
30F hx [**Doctor Last Name **] and idiopathic neutropenic who was recently d/c
s/p neck I&D of an infected abscess, now readmitted with
increased drain output and night sweats.  Found with
reaccumulated fluid collection and s/p I&D/washout on [**3-14**].

#Neck abscess: Pt presented to the ED after having previously
undergone a left neck incision for a posterior parapharyngeal
abscess on [**2124-3-4**]. She was treated with IV antibiotics and
discharged with a PICC line and continued ertapenem. She
re-presented on [**2124-3-14**] to the emergency room noting several
days of increasing swelling around the surgical site with
increasing drainage and pain, as well as night sweats and
fevers. CT scan of the neck showed reaccumulation of fluid in
her left cervical region concerning for worsening infection, and
patient was taken emergently to OR by ENT for L neck exploration
and incision and drainage. Procedure was well-tolerated and
proceeded without issue; 3 penrose drains were placed. No
fevers/chills while in house and no signs of sepsis. Was able to
protect airway, breath/swallow comfortably post-op. Per ID, it
was not felt that this episode was antibiotic failure, so she
was continued on meropenem.  She continued to spike temps >101
for the first few days post-op and eventually her fever curve
downtrended.  The penrose drains were removed every 1-2 days
until the final drain was removed on [**2124-3-24**]. Her wound and blood
cultures did not grow any organisms. Pt was treated with
meropenem while hospitalized with initial plan to switch to
ertapenem 2 days prior to discharge. However, LFTs were found to
be elevated on [**2124-3-24**] and [**2124-3-25**], which ID felt may be due to
ertapenem. Pt was then switched to daptomycin with improvement
of her LFTs. She was discharged on daptomycin for an indefinite
treatment course as will be defined by her infectious disease
doctors.

# [**Month/Day/Year **]: LFTs were elevated on [**2124-3-24**] w/ AST 192, AST
184, AP 310, and normal T bili 0.7. Pt's LFTs were also elevated
during prior admission when she was on meropenem and
hydromorphone for pain control. She has also received several
grams of acetaminophen daily during this hospitalization.
Suspect that this is due to a drug effect. Acetaminophen was
stopped and hydromorphone reduced, but LFTs continued ot
increase. Abdominal exam completely benign. RUQ ultrasound also
showed no obvious pathology. ID felt that ertapenem may be
contributing to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was switched for
daptomycin on [**2124-3-26**] with prompt resolution.

#Neutropenia of unknown cause: Baseline WBC per report ~1.8,
unclear etiology for her leukopenia.  Had follow-up with
heme/onc for a ? of WHIM syndrome, was planned for a bone marrow
biopsy as an outpatient.  ANCs were trended throughout without
requiring neupogen administration.  She will follow-up in
outpatient hematology with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**] in mid [**Month (only) **].

Transitional Issues:
-needs close monitoring while on daptomycin for resolution of
infection and myositis (with weekly CK)
-monitor LFTs for resolution of [**Month (only) **]
-needs continued workup for neutropenia

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. [**Known lastname **],

You came to the hospital for worsening neck swelling and
drainage after your prior neck surgery.  You had a scan, which
showed increased fluid in the previously drained areas of your
neck. Our ENT surgeons re-explored your neck and placed several
drains. You were seen by our infectious disease specialists, who
felt that your symptoms were due to incomplete drainage after
your first procedure. You were continued on antibiotics and your
wound and blood cultures did not grow any bacteria. Your ENT
surgeons slowly removed your neck wound drains and removed your
stitches. You will need to continue IV antibiotics for several
weeks to months. The exact duration will depend on your clinical
progress and the assessments of your ENT and infectious disease
doctors.

We have made the following changes to your medications:

START prochlorperazine maleate (Compazine) 10mg tablets, 1 tab
by mouth every 6 hours as needed for nausea

START docusate sodium 100mg capsules, 1 cap by mouth twice daily

START hydromorphone (Dilaudid) 2 mg tablets, 1-2 tabs by mouth
every 4-6 hours as needed for severe pain. Do not operate
machinery or drive on this medication. Do not mix with alcohol.

START polyethylene glycol (Miralax) 17g powder in packet, 1
packet dissolved in water by mouth daily as needed for
constipation

START daptomycin 350mg IV daily until instructed to stop by your
infectious disease specialist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]

Please continue to take your other medications as previously
prescribed. We have made several appointments for you (see
below). We have also arranged for a nurse to come to your home
to administer your medication and to draw your blood labs.
