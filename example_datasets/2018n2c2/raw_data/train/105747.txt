Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
atrial flutter

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
atrial flutter ablation, intubation


History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year old patient with a PMH of DMII, HTN, MI
([**2135**])and history of persistent atrial fibrillation for several
years. He is s/p atrial fibrillation ablation in [**5-23**] and had
recurrent atrial flutter post procedure which required 2 DCCV??????s
in [**8-22**]. He again was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13177**] for an episode of
Atrial Flutter and was cardioverted in [**7-24**]. Although he feels
reletively well in atrial flutter he has noticed a decrease in
exercise tolerance due to shortness of breath. He used to be
able to walk one mile but in the last 2 months his exercise
tolerance has decreased to unable to climb 1 flight of stairs.
He also experiences lightheadedess when bending over when he is
in atrial flutter. Since the patient was becoming more
sympomatic he was scheduled to undergo elective ablation.
.
During the procedure, initial BP was 168/109 (baseline). He got
etomidate and succ for intubation, followed by fentanyl and
midazolam. The procedure went well and his atrial flutter
converted to NSR. Immediately after conversion, patient became
hypotensive to 70/50. Stat echo showed mildly depressed EF
without signs of tamponade. He was started on phenylephrine
briefly which was quickly weaned prior to arrival in CCU. He was
extubated without difficulty prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to the CCU patient is in NAD, alert and animated. No
SOB, CP, dizziness, or nausea and vomiting.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for dyspnea on exertion,
ankle edema, and palpatations. However there is absence of chest
pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 59 year old patient with a PMH of DMII, HTN, ? MI ([**2135**])and
history of recurrent Atrial Fibrillation/ Atrial flutter
referred for elective Atrial flutter ablation on [**2142-10-12**], now
admitted to the CCU for management of his hypotension during
ablation requiring pressors.
.
# Rhythm: He was admitted for elective ablation.  The procedure
went well from a rhythm standpoint and his atrial flutter
converted to NSR.
.
In the CCU, he was monitorred on telemetry overnight and
remained in NSR.  Metoprolol was decreased to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]. [**Doctor Last Name **] of
Hearts monitorring was arranged prior to discharge, and he was
instructed to follow up with his cardiologist in 5 days.
.
The patient was therapeutically anticoagulated upon admission
and will continue his outpatient dose of warfarin with INR
monitorring upon discharge.
.
# Hypotension: Patient chronically hypertensive. Baseline SBP
160s-180s. During the procedure, initial BP was 168/109
(baseline). He got etomidate and succinylcholine for intubation,
followed by fentanyl and midazolam.  Immediately after reversion
to NSR, patient became hypotensive to 70/50. Stat echo showed
mildly depressed EF without signs of tamponade. He was started
on phenylephrine briefly which was quickly weaned. He was
extubated without difficulty and transferred to the CCU.  He had
no further episodes of hypotension.  In the CCU BPs were
100-140s systolic.  His home ACEI and metoprolol were restarted.

# Coronaries: Patient experienced a questionable MI in [**2135**] for
which he was cath and demonstrated 50% occlusion of an unknown
vessel.  Given that history, ASA was started.  He will discuss
whether it is appropriate to continue this with his
cardiologist.  ACEI and beta blocker were continued.  He was
noted to have been unable to tolerate statins secondary to
myalgias.
.
# Pump: Unknown EF.  Apparently euvolemic.  Lasix was continued
at home dose.
.
# Type II DM: Last HBA1C was 8.3%.  FS were initially 200s-300s
immediatley after procedure but well controlled subsequently.
Home insulin pump regimen was continued.
.
# Asthma:  No active disease.  Advair was continued
