History of Present Illness:
50 year old female presents to the ED with severe RLE and R.
back pain. She was in her usual state of health until about 2-3
weeks ago when she was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital with
shortness of breath and diagnosed with a RLE DVT and PE. She was
started on heparin ggt, however she developed a rectus sheath
hematoma, so this was stopped and an IVC filter was placed. She
was discharged home around [**11-7**] and had been well until
3 days ago when she developed acute onset of R. lower back pain
and right groin pain. This progressed over the past 3 days until
she came to the ED.

Cardiology reports:
ECG Study Date of [**2158-11-20**]  2:10:10 PM
Sinus rhythm. Low precordial lead QRS voltage is non-specific
and tracing is probably within normal limits. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

ECG Study Date of [**2158-11-22**]  2:21:10 AM
Sinus rhythm with borderline sinus tachycardia. QRS
configuration in
leads III and aVF raises the consideration of prior inferior
myocardial
infarction although is non-diagnostic. Otherwise, tracing may be
within normal limits but unstable baseline and baseline
artifacts in lead V3 makes assessment difficult. Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2158-11-20**]
axis is more leftward with a change in QRS configuration in lead
aVF and late precordial QRS transition is present. Otherwise,
there may be no significant change.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2158-11-22**] at 9:31:26 AM
FINAL: The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is a mild
resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis (velocities increased due to mild left
ventricular outflow gradient). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

ECG Study Date of [**2158-12-11**]  3:01:38 PM
Sinus tachycardia. Consider left atrial abnormality. Consider
prior inferior myocardial infarction, although it is
non-diagnostic. Delayed R wave progression with late precordial
QRS transition. Findings are non-specific. Since the previous
tracing of [**2158-11-22**] no significant change.

Radiology reports:
[**2158-11-20**] 2:23 PM
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) IMPRESSION: Left basilar atelectasis,
otherwise normal. Limited study.

[**2158-11-20**] 2:36 PM
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST; CT CHEST W/O
CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Right rectus abdominus muscle hematoma.
2. No retroperitoneal hematoma.
3. 18 x 23 mm hyperdense retroperitoneal lesion within the
aortocaval region, likely a lymph node, new from prior. A pelvic
MR can be obtained for further characterization.

[**2158-11-20**] 7:48 PM BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS
IMPRESSION: Extensive venous thrombosis extending through all
the deep veins of the right lower extremity and no evidence of
left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.

[**2158-11-20**] 7:49 PM RENAL U.S.
IMPRESSION: Normal study

[**2158-11-21**] 11:14 AM CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Ovoid area of high density within the aortocaval space at the
level of the IVC filter with adjacent fatty stranding which is
unchanged in size compared to the prior study. This finding is
concerning for a small, atable appearing retroperitoneal
hematoma.
2. Stable right rectus abdominis muscle hematoma.

[**2158-11-23**] 7:42 AM
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT
IMPRESSION: Limited exam, however a small amount of flow is now
visualized in the right common and superficial femoral veins,
which remain partially
occluded. Reconstituted flow within the right popliteal vein is
observed.

[**2158-11-27**] 8:26 AM PORTABLE ABDOMEN
IMPRESSION: Small bowel dilatation most consistent with ileus.

[**2158-11-29**] 3:06 PM LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)
IMPRESSION: Normal-appearing liver without focal lesion or
biliary ductal
dilatation.

[**2158-12-10**] 7:10 PM UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT
IMPRESSION: Limited exam; however, no evidence of DVT. Calf
veins could not be visualized.

[**2158-12-11**] 9:46 AM CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Minimal contraction in the right rectus sheath hematoma.
2. New asymmetric expansion of the left iliopsoas muscles, with
adjacent left retroperitoneal stranding and small focal fluid
collection posterior to the inferior pole of the left kidney.
Findings are compatible with new left retroperitoneal hematoma.
3. Post-surgical changes in the right groin, without associated
right groin or thigh hematoma. Inflammatory stranding is noted
throughout the soft tissues of the right thigh.
4. Aortocaval density is again demonstrated. As previously
described, it is decreased in size and attenuation, most likely
representing a small resolving hematoma.

Study Date of [**2158-12-13**] 11:22 AM
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval enlargement of left retroperitoneal hematoma, as
described above.
2. New small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
Otherwise unchanged CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis
compared to
[**2158-12-11**].


Brief Hospital Course:
[**2158-11-20**] Patient admitted via ED for increasing right lower
extremity pain and swelling. S/p IVC filter placement from an
OSH complicated by right rectus muscle hematoma, s/p several
units blood transfusion. In ED found to have creatinine in 8.4,
hydrated overnight, creatinine came down to 6.8. Renal consulted
and following. RLE US showed clot in deep veins of RLE from calf
to common femoral, cannot visualize iliacs. CT of pelvis and
abd. was done-Right rectus abdominus muscle hematoma. Renal
US-showed Both kidneys show patent main renal arteries and veins
with appropriate arterial and venous waveforms. RLE was ace
wrapped and elevated. Started heparin drip conservatively. Kept
NPO. RLE noted to have significantly diminished sensation from
toes -knee with no foot motor fucntion and drop foot.

[**2158-11-21**] Patient was scheduled for angiojet thrombectomy. Kept
NPO, pre-oped and consented. Patient had abd/pelvic CT-that
showed stable rectus muscle hematoma. Became unstable, BP down
to the 70's, given fluid, blood products, transferred to the
CVICU. Arterial line and central access lines were placed for
blood pressure monitoring. Continued to be oliguric, and
creatinine remain elevated. CPKs were sent that came back
elevated. Reanl consult placed, recommended Bicarb infusion
which was started. In the CVICU patient recieved more blood
tranfusions, started on Neo drip for BP support. Angio
thrombectomy cancelled. Renal service following. Heparin drip
continued. Patient had problems w/ hyperkalemia-treated w/
Insulin/Bicarb/D50/CaGluconate IV.

[**2158-11-22**] Remained in CVICU, continued to require fluid
resucitation w/ Bicard drip and Neo drip to maintain BP.
Compartment pressures were done by ortho service-found to be
elevated, w/ CPK elevated as well. Pre-oped and consented for
open venous thrombectomy and faciotomy. Taken to OR and
underwent RLE open venous thrombectomy and fasciotomy. Patient
tolerated procedure, was transferred back to the CVICU for
recovery. Portable TTE was done-w/ LVEF >55%.
