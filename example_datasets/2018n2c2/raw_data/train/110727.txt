History of Present Illness:
 Mr. [**Known lastname 17385**] is a 38 y.o. male with a history of psoriatic
arthritis on immunosuppresive therapy, HTN, HL, DM, cervicogenic
headaches who was recently discharged on [**1-8**] for left leg pain.
Pt reprots that he presented to the ED on [**2202-1-3**] for L heel pain
radiating to knees. He was initially treated with vanc and cipro
for question of septic left knee; the aspirate showed [**Numeric Identifier **] WBC
and 94% PMN but neg gram stain and culture and no crystals so
abx discontinued. LENI was negative for DVT or [**Hospital Ward Name **] cyst. No
fx on x-ray. This was thought to be a psoriatic arthritis flare,
so his prednisone was increased from his home dose of 30mg to
60mg daily with improvement in his inflammation. His pain
subsequently reutrned and repeat LENI was negative. Pt was
started on gabapentin for presumed fibromyalgia and discharged
yesterday on a stable pain regimen of MS contin with prn
dilaudid. He saw Rheum today who referred him to Derm for
evaluation of a superficial erythematous plaque, questioned
erythema nodosum. Derm did not think this was consistent but was
concerned about compartment syndrome so referred pt to ED.
.
In the ER, vitals were: T 98.2, P 79, BP 145/77, RR 17, O2sat
98. LENI neg for DVT but pt was noted to have an extensive left
posterior calf subcutaneous complex fluid collection. Ortho did
not see evidence of compartment syndrome and recommended
vascular c/s to rule out necrotizing fasciitis given the fluid
collection. Vascular did not think this was consistent with
necrotizing fasciitis. An MRI of the LE was done per Rads recs,
and this showed small fluid collections concerning for abscess
in his gastrocnemius that were too small to be drained with no
evidence of osteomyelitis. He was given vancomycin, zosyn, and
clindaycin. He also received his home meds of gabapentin, MS
contin, and po dilaudid. He was admitted to medicine with VS on
transfer: T 98.5, P 76, BP 136/68, RR 15, O2sat 98RA.
.
On evaluation on the floor, patient complains of persistent LE
pain and tenderness which is controlled on his pain regimen. His
LLE knee effusion has improved markedly since his recent
admission. He denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats.
.
ROS: Mild constipation d/t pain meds. Review of systems
otherwise negative.
.

Imaging:
[**2202-1-20**] US: No significant change in size of fluid collection
in the left popliteal fossa extending into the left posterior
calf, which contains small foci of gas.
.
[**2202-1-16**] US: 1. No evidence of left lower extremity DVT between
the left popliteal and common femoral veins. 2. Left popliteal
fossa collection extending into the calf, again seen.
.
[**2202-1-12**] CT of LLE - 1. Redemonstration of two loculated fluid
collections in the left calf. Slightly increased inferior extent
of the collection along the anteromedial edge of the medial head
of the gastrocnemius muscle. Otherwise no significant change. 2.
Subcutaneous edema along the anterior left leg, in keeping with
cellulitis, unchanged. 3. Small loculates of air within the
lower collection is attributed to recent aspiration procedure.
No other evidence of soft tissue emphysema identified.
.
[**2202-1-12**] TTE - The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No obvious
echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global LV systolic
function. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

[**2202-1-22**]
MRI calf
1. Persisted popliteus muscle collection and collection at the
anteromedial aspect of the medial head of the gastrocnemius
muscle.
2. Post-surgical findings following incision and drainage is a
new collection posterior to the medial head of the gastrocnemius
muscle, contiguous with the medial open skin defect and contains
low signal intensity foci, which may be due to air or possibly
packing.
3. Muscle edema in the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle
and vastus
medialis obliquus muscle, likely postoperative.
4. A small knee joint effusion and mild synovitis without
definite findings of septic arthritis. As previously noted, the
popliteus tendon sheath can communicate with the knee joint.
Cartilage thinning and subchondral cysts along patella may be
degenerative. Clinical correlation is requested.

.
[**2202-1-12**] Radiology UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS -1. Large complex
fluid collection tracking from the left popliteal fossa along
the medial left calf to the proximal mid calf region. Since it
is difficult to fully assess the extent and geography of this
collection on ultrasound, an MRI is suggested for further
characterization. 2. Smaller fluid collection at the left
anterior knee measuring 3.5 cm. 3. No evidence of deep vein
thrombosis in the left leg.
.
[**1-8**] LENIS: No left lower extremity DVT. Extensive left
posterior calf subcutaneous complex fluid collection.
.
[**1-8**] MRI calf:  1. Two loculated fluid collections concerning
for abcess collections, one in the substance of the popliteus
muscle, and the other along the anteromedial edge of the medial
gastrocnemius muscle.
2. Subcutaneous edema likely represents cellulitis in this
setting.
3. No evidence of osteomyelitis.
4. Limited assessment of knee joint -- please see comment (No
obvious direct communication between these collections and the
knee joint effusion is identified, but the popliteus abscess
does extend along the popliteus tendon, which can communicate
with the knee in some patients. Full assessment of the
relationship between the knee joint and popliteus is limited on
these views.)

Brief Hospital Course:
38 years old male with psoriatic arthritis on immunosuppression,
DM, HTN, HL p/w LLE erythema, swelling and pain, found to have
gastrocnemius abscesses and overlying cellulitis.
.
# Acute renal failure: Patient noted to have acutely elevated
creatinine after I&D by surgery.  All urine lytes testing
indicated pre-renal etiology. Resolved after fluid challenge. He
again had acute renal failure on [**2202-1-27**] in the setting of having
received increased doses of pain medications and resultant
hypoperfusion. His peak creatinine was 3.0, and resolved to his
baseline of 0.8-0.9 by the time of discharge.
.
# Left calf fluid collection with overlying cellulitis: No DVT
or [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst on multiple imaging studies.  No compartment
syndrome per Orthopedic evaluation.  No osteomyelitis on MRI and
not consistent with necrotizing fascitis per Vascular surgery.
It was noted on imaging that he had gastroceminis fluid
collection and overlying cellulitis.  No signs of septic joint
from evaluation of knee aspiration.  He had one positive blood
culture with pan-sensitive staph.  He was placed on zosyn, later
narrowed to nafcillin.  All other microbiology data were
negative.  IR and vascular surgery helped drained the fluid
collection.  Leg incision is to heal via secondary intention.
He developed a body rash that was determined to be folliculitis.
 He completed the 2 week course IV antibiotics in house.  His
major issue remained to be pain management.  He required a large
amount of narcotics to control his pain, but after overdose (see
below) he was switched to a very conservative regimen.  It was
determined that the swelling/fluid collection is from psoriatic
arthritis versus idiopathic spondylarthropathy. He was
discharged in stable condition. Muscle biospy showed necrotic
muscle with granulation tissue.
.
# Medication overdose: On [**2202-1-26**], on recommendation from the
pain service, patient's MS Contin dose was increased to 160 mg
TID from 130 mg TID, in addition to being ordered for PRN
Dilaudid. Later that night, Pt fell while ambulating. He had a
CT scan which was negative for acute intracranial pathologu.
Morning after the fall, Pt was noted to be somnolent and
hypotensive. He was given Naloxone 0.4 mg X3 and would arouse
briefly after each dose. He continued to be hypotensive after a
bolus of 1L of NS. He was transferred to the MICU for further
monitoring. In the MICU he was monitored closely and his
hypotension and mental status gradually improved. He was called
out back to the floor on [**2202-1-28**]. He never required intubation.
After being called out, he was normotensive and alert and
oriented X 3. It was believed his hypotension and altered mental
status were caused by medication overdose in the setting of
acute kidney injury.  He was discharged on oxycodone 5mg Q4
hours, which he did well on for the 3 days prior to his
discharge. He will follow up with the pain clinic as an
outpatient.
.
# Psoriatic arthritis: On Golimumab every month, azathioprine,
prednisone. Rheumatology was consulted and suggested to decrease
prednison level to 20mg from 30 mg.  He continued on PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
with Bactrim.  Indomethacin was held due to renal failure but
restarted on discharge.  He will continue to follow with
rhematology as an outpatient.
.
# DM: Continued on Lantus 8u qAM, 10u qPM with sliding scale
dictated by patient based on carbohydrate counting.  [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted and followed.
.
# HTN: Continued on HCTZ 25mg, lisinopril 40mg, metoprolol
succinate 100mg [**Hospital1 **].  Held HCTZ and lisinopril due to
ARF/hypotension and was restarted afterwards.
.
# Anemia: Patient found to be iron deficient and started on
supplementation. Patient informed he will need oupatient
evaluation to determine cause of this by his PCP.  (PCP informed
by letter).

# HL: Continued pravastatin
.
# OSA: Continued CPAP qhs
.
# GERD: Continued Donnatal prn

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**].

You were admitted because your left knee was swollen, red and
painful and you also had a pain on your left leg and foot. The
rheumatology team evaluated and took fluid from your knee. You
were initially treated with antibiotic for possible infection
and pain medications. The fluid was cultured for infection but
this was negative.  You did have a blood culture that was
positive and we provided you with a two week course of
antibiotics.  We also had interventional radiology and vascular
surgery to help drain the fluids from your leg.  This helped
your swelling.  You required a lot of pain medications to
control the pain, and at one point went to the ICU because your
system did not clear the medicines adequately. You are now on a
much more conservative pain regimen. You will follow up with
pain doctors as [**Name5 (PTitle) **] outpatient.  We determined that the fluid
collection is not due to infection, and more likely a
rheumatological problem.  [**Name (NI) **] will follow up with the
rheumatologists as an outpatient.

Please note we made the following changes to your medications.
1. Decrease prednisone from 60mg to 20mg
2. Stop MSContin
3. Stop gabapentin
4. Stop dilaudid
5. Start oxycodone every four hours for pain control. Never
drink alcohol, drive, or operate heavy machinery with this
medication.
6. Start iron supplementation
7. Start Sarna lotion and mupirocin cream for your rash and
follow up with your PCP for resolution
8. Start tylenol 1 gram every six hours as needed for pain. Do
not exceed 4 grams in one day.
9.  Start omeprazole daily to protect your stomach lining while
you are taking prednisone and indomethacin (which can cause
irritation)
10. Start colace and senna to ensure you have having bowel
movements while on oxycodone and iron supplementation. Don't
take these medicines when you are having loose stools.

Follow up with your PCP and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for the results from your
muscle biopsy, which are still pending.

A visiting nurse will be coming to your home to help with your
wound vac. Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (vascular) as listed
below.
