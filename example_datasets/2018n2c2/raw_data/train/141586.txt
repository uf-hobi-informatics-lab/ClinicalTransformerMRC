Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall with hematoma to right side of head

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
87 year-old woman with chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent left caudate lobe
infarct who presents after unwitnessed fall and an INR of 20.
Pt sustained two falls today while at home with PT/OT/VNA.
First fall was witnessed with no head trauma or LOC.  Second
fall was unwitnessed and caused hematoma to right side of head.
Pt does not recall falling or events immediately preceding fall
(she was using her cane). She denies dizziness, lightheadedness
or aura prior to event. No chest pain, palpitations. She was
able to put the hand to prevent hitting her head. She did not
feel very fatigued afterward, there were no abnormal movements.
She has rugs at home, but does not remember tripping.  After
falling, pt's next memory is of daughter taking her to her
primary care doctor, where she was found ot have an elevated INR
and administered 10 mg of PO Vitamin K. Pt denies any changes to
her medications including new antibiotics, changes in Coumadin
dosage, diet, or supplements. She denies any current alcohol or
social event.  She denies any fever, chills, diarrhea, nausea,
vomit or other signs of infection. She takes her medications by
herself and knows her Coumadin dose (2.5), but is unable to
mention other medications. She lives in an [**Hospital3 **],
where they do not supervise her in terms of her medications, but
has a VNA. Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further care.

In the ER her initial VS: BP 131/53, HR 83, RR 18, 97.7. On
physical exam she was A&OX3, had a hematoma in the right occiput
and lower lip laceration of 0.5 cm. She had C-collar and had
gross blood in the rectal vault. She had labs that were
significant for INR of 20.2 with PTT of 71.4, HCT of 37.7 at her
baseline. She underwent CT scan of the head and c-spine without
any abnormality and CT scan of abdomen and pelvis without acute
pathology. Patient was T&C and received 2 units of FFP. Her VS
were stable throughout the ER course. She was admitted to the
ICU for hemodynamic monitoring. GI was not called from the ER.

Pt was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2121-3-28**] for right
facial and upper lip angioedema, as well as a recent fall.  Pt's
daughter reports she was confused and altered from her baseline
mental status on day prior to admission.  Angiogedema improved
significantly with IV solumedrol and H1,H2 blockers.  A brain
MRI was obtained due to h/o altered mental status in setting of
fall, and was notable for an acute left caudate head infarct.
MRA of the neck demonstrated a 50% stenosis of the left proximal
internal carotid artery and 50% stenosis in both vertebral
arteries in the V2 segment. The TTE on [**2121-3-31**] was negative for
mural thrombus or cardiac source, but etiology of stroke felt
most likely cardioembolic in setting of subtherapeutic INR.  Pt
was discharged in stable condition to rehab.  On [**2121-4-12**], pt
returned to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with transient dizziness, R arm and face
weakness.  Head CT was negative for bleed, and neuro felt most
her presentation was most likely due to recrudescence of prior
caudate infarct in setting of mild dehydration.

Past Medical History:
- Left Caudate Head infarct
- Angioedema: pruritis and periorbital and lip/tongue edema,
previously intubated in MICU ([**12-16**]), etiology thought to be due
to lisinospril, which was subsequenlty discontinued. Recurrence
in [**3-19**] requiring MICU admission, managed with IV steroids and
H1/H2 blockers, no intubation required.
- Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia
- Osteoporosis
- Osteoarthritis
- S/p right hip replacement
- Eczema
- Hayfever as a child

Social History:
She lives by herself in an [**Hospital3 **] in [**Street Address(2) **] in
[**Location (un) **] MA. She cooks for herself often, has a VNA and home
PT. Denies any current or past history of smoking or illegal
substances. Drinks 1 cup of wine occasionally. Uses a walker.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year-old woman presents after falling down and hitting head,
admitted with GIB and supratherapeutic INR to ICU.  INR was >20
and was reversed with Vitamin K and 2 units of FFP.  Coumadin
held.  HCT was stable so decision was made not to pursue
colonoscopy.  Acute renal failure resolved with IVF.  The
patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for
continued monitoring of HCT and INR.

PROBLEM LIST:
#. Supratherapeutic INR: Unclear exactly why INR went so high.
Nutritional deficiency vs less efficient GI absorption of
Vitamin K vs drug-drug interaction causing decreased metabolism
of Coumadin.  She was reversed with Vitamin K and FFP and on
discharge her INR was 1.6.  After discussion with her primary
care provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] decision was made to restart coumadin at a
lower dose of 1.5mg daily and to have VNA check daily INR until
the levels are therapeutic.  After that, she may require INR
checks twice a week until stable.

#. Lower GI Bleed: No active bleeding after reversing
anticoagulation. HCT stable Source most likely either
diverticulosis or hemorrhoids bleeding in the setting of high
INR.  After discussions with her PMD, she was restarted on
coumadin at a lower dose at 1.5mg daily

#. Atrial fibrillation: Metoprolol dose reduced because of
bradycardia.  As above, her anticoagulation was held until
discharge.  She will restart coumadin at a lower dose at 1.5mg
daily.  She will need f/u regarding her HR and her BP.

#. Falling down / Gait instability: PT consult to determine
recommended level of home supervision

#. Acute Kidney Injury [**3-11**] GIB resulting in hypovolemia.
Resolved with IVF.

#. Hypertension: On Metoprolol. Held Amlodipine.  Restart if
needed for BP control

#. Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin

#. Angioedema: Continue Fexofenadine, Famotidine, and Prednisone

#. Thyroid nodules incidentally seen on CT scan: F/u with PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] thyroid US on previous admission that recommended f/u
imaging in 6 months.

#. CT torso demonstrated breast nodule which should be follow up
with mammography as an outpatient.

#. Nose skin hyperpigmented skin lesion: Outpatient follow up

#. DVT prophylaxis with pneumoboots

#. Code status - DNR/DNI

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after falling down and hitting your head.  You
were found to have an very elevated INR (>20) which is the
reason you had GI bleeding.  CT scans were performed and you did
not have any head or neck fractures.  Your INR was corrected
with Vitamin K and transfusion of plasma.  Your bleeding stopped
and your blood counts remained stable.

We recommend that you stop taking Coumadin until [**2121-5-13**].  You
should restart Coumadin at a lower dose of 1.5mg daily.  You
should restart this tonight.  You will need to call your primary
care provider's office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79255**] to get follow up
appointmen with your Dr. [**Name (NI) **].

CT scans showed incidental findings of thyroid nodule and breast
nodule.  These issues should be addressed with your primary care
physician.

MEDICATION CHANGES:
1. Restart coumadin 1.5mg daily.  You will need daily INRs drawn
and these will be faxed to your primary care [**Provider Number 34259**]. DECREASE DOSE of Metoprolol to 6.25mg twice a day (The dose
was decreased because your heart rate was too slow)
3. STOP Amlodipine (This was stopped because your high blood
pressure is not currently requiring this medication to be
controlled)
