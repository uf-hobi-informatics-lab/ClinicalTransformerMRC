Pertinent Results:
[**2149-5-10**] MRI BRAIN w/ & w/o contrast:
FINDINGS: A mass measuring approximately 5 x 5 x 6 cm appears to
arise from the sella turcica and extend into the suprasellar
cistern. The mass is inhomogeneous in intensity, but
predominantly hypointense to brain on the short TR images and
markedly hyperintense on FLAIR and long TR spin echo images.
There is a prominent cystic component anteriorly, extending into
the right frontal lobe. This measures approximately 4 x 5 x 6
cm. The mass enhances inhomogeneously after contrast
administration. The sella turcica is markedly enlarged. The mass
extends into the prepontine cistern and grossly fills the left
cavernous sinus. The left internal carotid artery is encased in
its cavernous and supraclinoid portions as it courses through
the mass.  The optic chiasm is traumatically elevated by the
lesion, and I cannot identify the course of the optic nerves as
they pass over this lesion to approach the optic canals. This
lesion appears most likely to represent a pituitary adenoma.

The mass elevates the third ventricle and causes compression at
the level of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**]. This apparently is
responsible for bilateral dilatation of the lateral ventricles,
more severe on the right than left.

CONCLUSION: Massive sellar and suprasellar enhancing neoplasm,
most likely a pituitary adenoma. There is compression of the
optic chiasm and hydrocephalus due to elevation and compression
of the ventricular system at the level of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].

[**2149-5-11**] CTA Head: Large sellar and suprasellar mass with
components in the pontine cistern, cavernous sinus, suprasellar
cistern, and invaginating into the right  frontal lobe. The
appearance remains consistent with a pituitary adenoma.  There
is encasement of the left internal carotid artery and the
anterior cerebral arteries bilaterally course through the
lesion.

[**5-14**] CT Head:
No significant change in large suprasellar mass leading to right
lateral ventricular dilation. There is no evidence of interval
hemorrhage.


[**5-14**] CT Head postop:
In comparison to a study obtained five hours prior, there is
notable
improvement in right lateral ventricular dilatation and right
frontal cystic lesion. There is no hemorrhage along the course
of the right ventriculostomy catheter, which is terminating in
the third ventricle. Small-to-moderate pneumocephalus is likely
post-surgical.

[**5-15**] CT Head: In comparison to [**2149-5-14**] exam, there is mild
improvement in ventricular size. No evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage. Small-to-moderate pneumocephalus
persists, likely post-surgical.

[**5-17**] CT Head -
1. Stable size of the ventricles compared to [**2149-5-15**], with mild
dilatation of the right lateral ventricle.
2. The large sellar/suprasellar mass, with a large cystic
component indenting the right frontal lobe

[**5-23**] Ct head - s/p r VP shunt, no acute hemorrhage


Brief Hospital Course:
26M who was admitted to Neurosurgery for a right frontal cystic
lesion and a sellar/suprasellar mass with subsequent
hydrocephalus. He admitted to the ICU for close observation
given his imaging. A MRI was obtained on [**5-10**] to better evaluate
the lesions.

On [**5-11**] a CTA head was obtained for surgical planning. Endocrine
was also consulted given the sellar/suprasellar mass. Per
Endocrine request, labs were ordered and a cortisol stimulation
test was done on [**5-12**] AM. Hydrocortisone was held in order to
perform cortisol stim test.a 1 gram Dilantin bolus was given for
a serum dilantin level of 0.8. Overnight the patient became very
aggitated, pulling out his IV line requiring ativan.  The
patient got out of bed and wanted to leave the hospital "Against
Medical Advice"

On [**5-12**], patient was seen to have bitemporal hemianopsia, but
was otherwise intact on examination. The Cortisol Stim teast was
performed and the cortisol levels at 30 minites, 60 minites and
90 minites were.2-30 mins,21-60 mins,22- 90 mins.  Neuro-optho
was consulted for formal visual field testing which was done on
[**2149-5-13**] which demonstrated stable bitemporal hemianopsia.
Endocrine recommended stopping the hydrocortisone and decreasing
the decadron. Neuro and rad oncology were also consulted.

On [**2149-5-14**], Patient underwent am aspiration of the right frontal
cyst and EVD placement.  He tolerated the procedure well without
intraoperative complications.  Please review dictated operative
report for details. He was extubated and transferred to the ICU.
Post operative Head CT revealed no hemorrhage and significant
decompression.  He was bolused with 500mg of Dilantin for a
subtherapeuric level of 7.2 and his dose was increased to 200mg
[**Hospital1 **].

On [**5-15**] the EVD was clamped after CT head demonstrated stable
ventricular size however it had to be opened approximately
2.5hrs after clamping for severe headache and episode of
confusion.  It was opened at 10cm above the tragus.  Per
Endocrinology the patient was given cabergoline 0.5mg as a
one-time dose and the patient was switched from dexamethasone to
prednisone 7.5mg daily according to their recommendations.  He
was given a Dilantin bolus of 500mg for a Dilantin level of 9.6.


On [**5-16**] the patient's mental status was stable and so an EVD
wean was started.  The patient tolerated elevation of the drain
to 20cm above the tragus.  Dilantin level was therapeutic at
12.9.  Pt was transfered to the stepdown unit.  His ventricular
drain was clamped several times but patient continued to have
elevated ICPs and severe headaches.  Plan for VP shunt was
postponed on [**5-20**] for fever to 102.7.  Fever workup was negative
for DVT with lower extremity Dopplers, negative consolidation on
chest xray.  Blood, urine and CSF cultures were sent on [**5-20**].
He devoloped a total body rash that resembled a reaction to
dilantin and so the patient was transitioned to Keppra, Dilantin
was stopped and the rash was treated topically with
hydrocortisone cream and with Oral benadryl PRN.  No respiratory
distress, no oral swelling. He was afebrile on [**5-21**] and was
neurolopgically stable with EVD in place while awaiting VP shunt
placement.

On [**2149-5-23**], patient had a right VP shunt place by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. On
the day of surgery he had stress dose steroids with
Hydrocortisone 50mg Q8 and then resumed prednisone 7.5mg daily.

Now DOD, pt is afebrile, vital signs are stable, and tolerating
a good oral diet.  His pain is well controlled and incision
appear clean/dry/intact.  He is set for d/c home in stable
condition.
