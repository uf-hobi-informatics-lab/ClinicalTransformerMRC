IMPRESSION:
1. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
2. Small amount of free perihepatic fluid.
3. Collapsed gallbladder with wall edema and small amount of
pericholecystic
fluid. These findings could be due to a variery of chronic
conditions
including hypoalbuminemia, chf, or can be seen in hepatitis.
There is no
evidence to suggest acute inflammation.
.
CXR: [**2114-12-18**]
Very severe heterogeneous opacification has developed in the
left upper lobe.  Left lower lobe was collapsed in [**Month (only) 1096**], now
reexpanded and densely consolidated. There may be left hilar
adenopathy and small left pleural effusion. Overall, findings
are consistent with extensive pneumonia though under the
appropriate clinical circumstances, this could be infiltrated
malignancy. Small region of ground-glass opacity in the right
apex persists since the chest CT done on [**2114-1-13**].
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding and right lung
shows some mild vascular redistribution but I do not believe
pulmonary edema is playing any role.
.
-[**2114-12-21**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknessis is normal. There is normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Doppler
parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

-[**2114-12-24**] CT chest:
1. Multifocal pneumonia, comparable in extent to the appearance
on the chest radiograph, [**12-23**], which has progressed since
[**12-18**]. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also
comparable and not of sufficient size to suggest empyema. There
are no characteristics of the widespread pulmonary infection, to
permit discriminating among possible causes: virus, bacteria, or
fungus.
2. Minimal increase in size and number of mediastinal lymph
nodes, presumably reactive. More substantial left hilar
adenopathy cannot be excluded, but if present, is not
obstructive, and is equally likely to be reactive.
3. New tiny right middle lobe lung nodule.
4. Small pleural and pericardial effusions could be sympathetic
to infection, or residual from prior cardiogenic edema

-[**2114-12-27**] CT head
No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No acute intracranial process

-[**2114-12-30**] MRI/MRA
Multiple areas of restricted diffusion are seen in both cerebral
hemispheres involving frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. No
focal acute infarcts are seen within the posterior fossa. The
distribution is in the watershed region in the left frontal
lobe, but otherwise, it is in the cortical and subcortical
region of both cerebral hemispheres. There is no acute
hemorrhage identified. There is no mass effect, midline shift or
hydrocephalus. Mild-to-moderate brain atrophy is seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple small acute cortical and subcortical infarcts
including infarct in the left frontal watershed distribution as
described above. Mild diffuse decreased signal within the bony
structures of the head could be due to marrow hyperplasia or
infiltration and clinical correlation recommended.
MRA OF THE NECK: Neck MRA shows normal flow in carotid and
vertebral arteries without stenosis or occlusion.
  IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the neck.
MRA HEAD: Head MRA demonstrates normal flow in the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation.
  IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head

-[**2115-1-1**] TTE Bubble Study: No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo with myelodysplastic syndrome (RARS), presently D15C5
azacitidine presenting with fever, neutropenia, profound anemia,
diarrhea and cough with fever, lung exam concerning for PNA.
.
Respiratory Distress: Patient presented with profound anemia
likely secondary to her MDS. She received 5 UPRBC with
improvement of her HCT from 13.6 on admission to 23.2. She
developed respitratory distress likely secondary to combined
insult of her pneumonia and volume overload for which she
triggered. She was found to be in flash pulmonary edema. She
received supportive therapy. Her respiratory status improved and
she was transferred to the floor. She was started on albuterol
nebulizer treatement for possible bronchospasm, but this may not
need to be continued at the rehabilitation facility.
.
PNA/recurrent fevers: She had presented to clinic where she was
found to be febrile to 102 and neutropenic. a CXR showed a Left
lower lobe pneumonia. She was started on vancomycin and
cefepime. A DFA was negative. Blood cultures were negative. In
the interim, the patient was managed with meropenem,
voriconazole, azithromycin, and vancomcyin in the setting of
recurrent fevers and night sweats. She was discharged after
being afebrile for 1-2 days, with a short course of meropenem to
be completed.
.
MDS/Anemia: She has a history of sideroblastic anemia for which
she is on azacitidine. She received 5 units of pRBC over the
first 2 days of her hospitalization. There was a consideration,
given the recurrent fevers and night sweats, that the patient
had a hematologic etiology, perhaps transformation to AML.  A
smear was obtained and was unremarkable, so bone marrow biopsy
was deferred. She received a unit of pRBC on the day of
discharge, which she completed prior to transfer to
rehabilitation.
.
Altered mental status/right hand-wrist weakness: The patient
developed right hand/wrist weakness on [**12-26**]. The patient also
developed attention/cognitive deficits. An MR head was obtained
which showed a likely watershed infarct in the left frontal
cortex, with multiple focal lesions in both hemispheres. LP was
negative for meningitis. TTE bubble study was negative for PFO
or ASD. EEG was performed with results pending at time of
discharge. Her mental status improved considerably and she had a
clear thought process, and was consistently oriented to her
name, the name of her hospital, and the month/year.
.
LFT elevation: Hepatitis serologies were negative, as were
smooth Antibodies. She did have a positive [**Doctor First Name **] with titer
pending. Hepatic US showed Small amount of free perihepatic
fluid, collapsed gallbladder with wall edema, and small amount
of pericholecystic fluid. LFTs were improved by day of
discharge.
.
Neutropenic Fever: Her neutropenia was likely secondary to her
chemotherapy. She was placed on neutropenic precautions and her
ANC was trended.  Her neutropenia resolved with periodic dosing
of neupogen. She had had no fevers for 1-2 days prior to
discharge. Per ID recommendations, she was discharged on
meropenem, to be continued for six days following discharge.
.
Prophylaxis: She did not receive heparin SQ prophylactically
given the contraindication posed by her azacitidine therapy.  As
her platelet count remained normal, and there was no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage on imaging, SC heparin was given for DVT
prophylaxis.

Discharge Condition:
Medically stable for discharge to rehabilitation facility.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you were fatigued and
having fevers. You were found to have a pneumonia treated with
antibiotics. You also received blood transfusions. Your
breathing initially improved, however your lungs became
overloaded with fluid and you went to the intensive care unit.
Your breathing improved and you came back to the regular floor.
.
You coninued to have difficulty with your breathing and
continued to have fevers so procedures were done to sample your
lung fluid to culture and remove some of the fluid, which did
not show obvious infection. Your pnuemonia was treated with
antibiotics. You also developed some mild confusion and right
hand weakness, due to a stroke, which was seen on MRI. A lumbar
puncture did not show any infection of your cerebrospinal fluid.
You had an EEG exam to look for seizure activity, the final
results of which were pending at the time of discharge.
.
The following changes were made to your medications:
-You were started on MEROPENEM, an intravenous antibiotic. You
will have an IV line placed at the rehabilitation facility to
receive this medication. You will continue to take this for six
days post-discharge, with your last doses on [**2115-1-8**].
-Added Guaifenesin 100 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: 5-10 MLs PO Q6H (every
6 hours) as needed for cough.
-Added Benzonatate 100 mg Capsule, One Capsule by mouth 3 times
a day
-Added Acetaminophen 325-650 mg by mouth every eight hours as
needed for fever; PLEASE DO NOT EXCEED 2000MG/ DAY
-Added Albuterol 0.083% Nebulizer to be inhaled every four
hours, as needed for shortness of breath or wheeze
.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you feel
faint, light headed, experience nausea, vomiting, constipation,
headache, blurry vision, weight loss, night sweats, chest pain,
abdominal pain, shortness of breath, muscle aches, joint aches,
fever, blood in your stool or urine, or any other symptoms that
are concerning to you.
