Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation/extubation

History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 53 year-old gentleman with HCV cirrhosis and
refractory lymphoblastic lymphoma/ALL on rituximab and
prednisone who presents with altered mental status. His mother
found him this morning with increased lethargy and complaining
of diffuse back pain. The back pain was unchanged from his usual
back pain, secondary to his ALL, and was not relieved by
morphine or methadone. He was recently admitted to the BMT
service from [**11-27**] until [**12-1**] for fevers and progressive ALL.
Infectious work-up was unremarkable and his fevers were
atrributed to a reaction to platelet transfusion. Of note, he
had another admission earlier in [**Month (only) **] at which point he
developed a strep viridans line infection (from PICC line)-- the
PICC line was removed, he was treated with a course of PCN G
which was changed to augmentin at his last admission with the
last dose due either yesterday or today. After finding him this
morning, his mother brought him back to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] today for
readmission and an ambulance was called from there to bring him
to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.3, BP 122/83, HR 100, RR 12,
100% on 4L. He was sleepy but A+O x3. Pt was noted to be very
uncomfortable, complaining of back pain. While in the ED, he
became
more delirious, writhing around in bed, refusing pain
medications, and perseverating on wanting to get out of bed to
urinate. Pt was intubated for CT head and abdomen. Spiked temp
to 101.8 rectally but remained hemodynamically stable. He was
given ceftriaxone, vanco, and acyclovir for empiric meningitis
coverage. LP was deferred given platelet count of 14. CT head
was negative and CT abdomen was notable for slightly worsened
ascites, new bibasilar opacities. Attempts to place OGT and
foley were unsuccessful and patient was noted to only have 40cc
of UOP while in the ED.

Past Medical History:
<b>HEMATOLOGIC/ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:</b>
Mr. [**Known lastname 2479**] was diagnosed with lymphoblastic lymphoma in
[**2116-1-31**].  He presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2115-12-30**] with
complaints of diffuse myalgias and arthralgias. A CT scan
demonstrated multiple enlarged portahepatis lymph nodes (largest
1.5 x 2.7 cm)and portacaval lymph nodes (largest 1.9 cm x 3.4 )
as well as multiple mildly enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes, the
largest measuring 1.2 x 1.9cm. On [**2116-1-6**], he underwent a
CT-guided fine-needle aspiration of a portahepatis lymph node
which was nondiagnostic.
A bone marrow biopsy was obtained on [**2116-2-26**], demonstrating
involvement by high-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
Tumor cells were diffusely positive for pan B cell markers CD20
and PAX-5, with co-expression of CD10 and bcl-2.  TdT staining
was equivocal, with predominantly cytoplasmic staining and a
rare cell with dim nuclear staining.  MIB-1 staining showed an
overall proliferation index of 50-60%, with focal areas with a
higher fraction.  The differential diagnosis was felt to include
lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (precursor B-cell
lymphoma/leukemia) or a blastic transformation/progression of a
mature B cell lymphoma. It was noted that a definitive diagnosis
would require flow cytometry and molecular studies, which could
not be performed because there were no blasts in the peripheral
blood and a marrow aspirate could not be obtained (dry tap).
However, the peripheral blood sample was sent for
immunophenotyping, which demonstrated a new population of CD34
positive cells and a small population of CD19 positive cells in
the "blast" gait, without expression of TdT.  It was felt that
these findings should be interpreted with caution since no
blasts were identified on a corresponding peripheral smear.
Given his significant liver dysfunction and other medical
co-morbidities, the initial treatment regimen chosen for the
patient consisted of R-CHOP, which was initiated on [**2116-3-4**].
He received a second cycle of chemotherapy on [**2116-3-24**],
consisting of R-CHOP without vincristine, which was held
secondary to neuropathy. Modified Hyper-CVAD Course A was given
on [**2116-4-10**], with a second course given on [**2116-5-15**] and a third
course on [**2116-6-22**]. Course B was not given due to his history of
hepatic cirrhosis. Of note, the patient has known retinal
involvement by his lymphoma, for which he is followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] of ophthalmology. A liver biopsy on [**5-8**] and repeat bone
marrow biopsies on [**6-12**] and [**7-19**] have shown no evidence of
recurrent lymphoma.
The patient presented on [**2116-10-15**] with myalgias, headache,
mental status changes, and fevers. A CBC showed a WBC of 7.2
with 14% blasts. A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated marked
fibrosis and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. He
was treated with rituximab 500mg, given in three doses of 100mg,
200 mg, and 200mg on [**10-9**] - [**10-11**]. In addition, he was treated
with rituximab 375mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 750mg/m2, doxorubicin
20mg/m2, and dexamethasone 20mg from [**10-19**]- [**10-21**].
The patient was noted to have recurrence of peripheral blasts on
[**2116-11-9**], with a bone marrow biopsy on [**2116-11-11**] showing residual
leukemia in the marrow. After extensive discussion, he opted to
continue palliative chemotherapy with rituximab and prednisone.
Rituximab was started on [**2116-11-16**] at 100mg, with plans to
continue threrapy with 200mg daily on [**11-17**] and [**11-18**].

CXR (s/p intubation): Although on the frontal view, the
electronic measurement of the distance from the ET tube tip to
the carina is less than 6 cm, the tip is above the upper margin
of the clavicles, and it is probably 3 cm above optimal
placement, with the discrepancy explained by marked patient
kyphosis. Aside from mild plate-like atelectasis at the base of
the left base, lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion.
Heart size is normal.
.
CT abd/pelvis: Slightly worsened ascites. No change in
splenomegaly, cholelithiasis, portal lymphadenopathy. Bibasal
opacities new since [**Month (only) 359**], could be due to atelectasis,
pneumonia, aspiration.
.
CT head: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities. MR
with
gadolinium would be more sensitive for intracranial infections
or masses.
.
KUB: Non-specific bowel gas pattern without free intraperitoneal
air.
.
CXR PA and lat: Interpretation is limited by patient rotation
and
kyphotic angulation. However, there is no evidence of pleural
effusion or focal consolidation. Allowing for change in
positioning, the study is overall not significantly changed
since [**2116-11-27**]. There is a focus of linear atelectasis at the
left lung base. Wedge compression deformities of two low
thoracic vertebral bodies are unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was a 53 year-old male with a history of relapsing
refractory ALL on prednisone and rituximab and HCV cirrhosis who
presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension.
Patient was hypotensive, started on pressors, given IVF,
worsened in the setting of adrenal insuffiency, and synthetic
hepatic dysfunction. Patient was intubated. Once infectious
etiology was eliminated, patient's dim prognosis was discussed
with family and a determination was made to make the patient
CMO. Patient was extubated and started on morphine drip.
Patient, due to high drug tolerance, continued to have pain and
was responsive on morphine drip. Patient was transferred from
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to BMT floor for CMO continuation. Patient continued to
show signs of discomfort and sedatation was switched to dilaudid
and ativan drip. Patient expired at 7:20 pm on [**2116-12-10**]
secondary to respiratory failure from relapsing refractory ALL
in the presence of the family. The proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 2479**], the
patient's son, consented to a full autopsy.
