Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure and intubated

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
46 yo man with history of cervical spinal cord injury, s/p C3-6
ACDF and remaining quadriplegia, indwelling suprapubic
catheter/recurrent UTIs, baclofen pump, COPD, OSA who presented
to OSH with after his wife noted seizure like activity with
subsequent unresponsiveness.
.
Per wife and pt. over the past 10 days, they noted several
episodes they thought were seizures.  These are described as
head turning to the right, facial grimacing, gutteral sounds,
lasting 1-2 mins at a time with subsequent impaired ability to
respond to her which resolved within 5-10 mins. He has had a
total of four events of similar nature, although on one
occasion, patient states that he actually recalled having these
symptoms.  She notes that on that occasion, patient was actually
yawning.  The night prior to evaluation, while going to sleep,
wife noted another episode similar to above, however this time,
after 2 mins of these events, patient did not return respond to
her at all. Wife noted that his eyes rolled backwards and this
was followed by tremmors of b/l UEs.  Wife also notes that ~ 1mo
ago he was admitted to [**Hospital **] Rehab, where multiple medication
changes were made, which she can not recall.
.
EMS arrived  and VS were 132/P, 88, RR 8, irregular, 2mm pupils
and was unresponsive.  Was placed on NRB, 1mg Narcan was given
and reported to be last seen at baseline 3hrs prior by wire.
After a few mins, was responsive to noxious stimuli. "No obvious
signs of seizure activity noted."
.
While at OSH ([**Hospital3 26615**]), initial VS were 96.6F 150/p 12 88
100% NRB and HR varied 80-140s.  He was noted to have pinpoint
pupils and given a total of 4 mg of Narcan without effect,
followed by intubation for airway protection in setting of
unresponsiveness to vocal or noxious stimuli purposefully, but
only with h/n movements.  CT head was negative for ICH, with nl
electrolytes, troponins, WBC of 7K and HCT of 46, INR 3.1, Ca
[**34**].8, Trop < 0.03, .  Utox was positive for opiates/methadone
(on methadone/vicod) and benzodiazepines (valium), UA postive
for Nitrites.  ECG was SR w/ Twf in III and IVCD.
.
On arrival to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], VS were "Afebrile," 65 20 106/66
100% on 450/16/40%/5.  Per neurology c/s, bedside EEG was
obtained (read pending) who were concerned re: sz from baclofen
toxicity.  Anesthesia interrogated the baclofen pump working
appropriately and also obtained history of intermittent
benzodiazepine use, gabapentin use. Patient's ECG was SR, CXR
w/o acute process.  Laboratory values were notable for ABG of
7.51/48/84/40, with Chem 7 notable for Cl 97 and HCO3 of 39 and
Na 142 with Cr 0.5.  WBC 10K w/ HCT of 46% and MCV of 103, PT
37.3, PTT: 65.7, INR: 3.6.  He received a 1g Vancomycin, and 1g
of CFTX.  Was maintained on midazolam gtt.
.
On transfer, VS were 65 108/65 24 100% on 450/16/40%/5 and is
intermittently responding to verbal commands (do you have
pain?).
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were wnl.  Patient opened
eyes and followed simple 2 step commands.
.
Per d/w Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **], no recent changes to baclofen pump, 8wks
ago, increased by 15% w/o effect (~ 1000mcg daily), last month
also had a myelogram that showed normal function for the pump
but tone has increased significantly over the past [**1-23**] year.

Imaging:
EEG [**2136-5-16**]:  This is an abnormal EEG because of the presence of

infrequent epileptic discharges in the occipital regions as well
as
nearly continuous slowing in these regions. These findings are
indicative of potential bioccipital epileptogenic foci with
underlying
subcortical dysfunction. In addition, background showed diffuse
slowing
suggestive of a mild encephalopathy of non-specific etiology. No

electrographic seizures are present.
.
CXR [**2136-5-16**]:  Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates ET
tube terminating 2.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is
positioned in the stomach. Low lung volumes. Retrocardiac
opacity obscures the left hemidiaphragm. Right lung base opacity
is also noted. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar
and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size is
normal.  There is no pulmonary edema. Partially imaged upper
abdomen is notable for air-filled prominent stomach and bowel
loops.
.
EEG [**2136-5-18**]:  This is an abnormal portable EEG, because of mild
diffuse
background slowing with intermittent bursts of further slowing
indicative of a mild diffuse encephalopathy of nonspecific
etiology. No
epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are present.
Note is
made of a slower than average cardiac rate.
.
MR C spine with and without contrast [**2136-5-19**] (PRELIM REPORT!!!):

1. Diffuse cervical spinal cord atrophy with cystic myelomalacia
at C4-5 at the site of prior contusion. No abnormal enhancement
is seen.
2. Post-surgical changes from anterior cervical fusion and
instrumentation at C3-C5 levels and C3-C6 laminectomies.
3. Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine, most
prominent at C4-C5 and C5-C6 as described above.


Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo man with history of cervical spinal cord injury, s/p C3-6
ACDF and remaining quadriplegia, indwelling suprapubic
catheter/recurrent UTIs, baclofen pump, COPD, OSA who presented
to OSH with after his wife noted seizure like activity with
subsequent unresponsiveness, s/p 1 day intubation.  Admission
complicated by hypotension, bradycardia, hypoventillation.
.
# Hypotension, bradycardia, hypopnea:  Patient presented
hypotensive to SBP high 70-80 without reflex tachycardia (HRs as
low as 40s).  Hypotension was not responsive to extensive volume
challenge (given 7.5 L NS in 24 hours).  The etiology appears to
be a combination of increased vagal tone and medication effect.
The HR and BP responded to atropine challenge, indicating
increased vagal tone from some offending process.  Started on
scopalomine patch.  He was later also started on midodrine for
further pressure support.  The etiology of the increased vagal
tone was most likely related to the UTI.  The other major
factors contributing was probably excess benzodiazepine and
opioid. He had pinpoint pupils when he first came in.  On his
home doses of medications the patient had a low respiratory
rate, and retained CO2 on ABG.  The chronic hypopnea may lead to
increased bradycardia.  The patient's diazepam and methadone
doses were decreased as below.
.
# Complicated UTI (enterococcus and serratia): Patient presented
with foul smelling urine which is consistent with prior UTIs. He
never had a fever, but he may have been unable to mount fever
due to level of spinal cord lesion. Patient was initially on
broad spectrum antibiotics but was narrowed based upon OSH
culture data.  Following 4 days of IV antibiotics, the patient
was narrowed to PO amoxicillin for enterococcus plus cipro for
serratia. Will receive a total of 14 days of abx for complicated
UTI.  Last dose of Abx to be given on [**2136-5-31**].
.
# Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy.  The patient was admitted
following sustained altered mental status after an episode of
clonic movements, thought by wife to represent seizure activity.
 Resolved per wife on admission to the ICU, but patient
continued to be sedated with flat affect.  Now much improved
once decreased opiates, likely medication effect, as well as
encephalopathy related to the UTI.  Methadone dose was
decreased. Diazepam dose was decreased. EEG was negative for
seizure activity. Unclear if patient actually had seizure
leading up to original presentation but no evidence during this
hospitalization. More likely patient had toxic/metabolic
derangements described above. Of note, the patient's wife was
very concerned that the movements she saw (eyes rolling back in
head, patient becoming confused) had happened a previous time
when the patient received cymbalta. Cymbalta was stopped.
.
# ? Syringx: Patient had been recently diagnosed with cervical
syringx per OSH records. However repeat MRI here did not show
syringx but did show diffuse cervical spinal cord atrophy with
cystic myelomalacia at C4-5 at the site of prior contusion. This
was conveyed to one of the patient's primary neurologists, Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 27598**].
.
# COPD.  On albuterol at home.  Chronically retaining CO2.
Decreased diazepam and methadone to increase respiratory drive.
Continue albuterol PRN.
.
# DVT.  After discussion with patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 61384**], it does
not appear that any documentation of DVT exists. The patient had
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] IVC filter placed at the time of his spinal cord
injury, and has been on anticoagulation since then. Current
recommendations are that patients with IVF filters be
anticoagulated if there are no contraindications (since IVC
thrombi can develop). Given absence of contraindications, the
patient's coumadin was continued.
.
# OSA:  Patient has previous diagnosis of OSA however he has
declined CPAP at home and here due to discomfort.  Nasal cannula
at night to maintain O2 sats

# Chronic PAIN:  Pain medications decreased, as above, for
respiratory suppression and sedation.  Patient remained with
controlled pain on decreased methadone to 10mg qid.  Patient
also started on lidocaine patch.
