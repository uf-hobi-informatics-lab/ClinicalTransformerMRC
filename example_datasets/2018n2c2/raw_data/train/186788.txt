Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71415**] is a 74M w/DM on glyburide, renal xplant in [**2105**] [**1-26**]
hereditary nephritis, lymphoma 9ya s/p RCHOP, SCC scalp excised
in [**2120-6-23**], afib on flecainide, MS, circumcision last week who
presented to the ED w/2 days of hypoglycemia, also found to have
low BP.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 71415**] is not aware of why he is in the hospital.  He is able
to describe frequent falls [**1-26**] MS which increased over [**Holiday **]
and New Years.  He denies vertigo with the falls, but does
report decreased streadiness when his blood sugars are low.  He
takes his own medications and his list is extensive as below.
.
He presented to [**Hospital 882**] hospital yesterday with mental status
changes, BG18 and hyopthermia.  His urinalysis was negative at
that time and he was sent home.  He returned w/hypoglycemia and
was thus transferred to BDIMC.  In our ED, his VS were 100.6
104/58  80  98RA w/next BP 86/50.  He was given 1L NS, 1/2A D50,
D10 drip and levofloxacin.  At the time of transfer to the CCU
under MICU service, his BP was 89/63 and FS142.
.
His ROS is notable for the falls, dysphagia to solid foods for
years, mild dysphagia, and recent GI ilness (upper and lower) of
his wife for a few weeks; he had similar symptoms for several
days two weeks ago.  While he gives some detailed history, his
answers to many questions are tangential and circumstantial, and
in response to being asked why he is here, he describes a
vacation that he took with his wife to [**Name2 (NI) **] five years ago,
and her diarrheal ilness.  His PCP reports that this is baseline
for him.  His wife reports that he takes all of his own
medications, and does not typically make mistakes.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
74M w/MMP as above admitted w/hyoglycemia, hypotension, and
low-grade fever 13d s/p circumcision.  It is not clear if his
glyburide was recently increased--this could be a primary
contributor to his presentation.  He has an evident ballantitis
which could also be contributing.
.
1) Hypoglycemia- Thought to be most likely [**1-26**] glyburide in the
context of recent illness and polypharmacy.  On the evening
following admission, his blood glucose levels were maintained at
normal levels with D51/2NS gtt titrated to q1 hour fingersticks.
 Glyburide's half life is 24 hours, and in keeping with this,
hypoglycemic effect wore out within 24 hours of admission.
Subsequently blood glucose levels were >200 and the dextrose
support was discontinued.  With the resolution of hypoglycemia,
sliding scale insulin was initiated.  After transfer from the
MICU, the patient had blood sugars > 250.  He was started on low
dose glipizide prior to discharge.  Although Glipizide still has
some interaction with voriconazole, it has less interaction that
Glyburide.  The patient had been on Glyburide and Voriconazole
for many years prior to this episode of hypoglycemia and it was
not clear why the patient had hypoglycemia.  The Glipizide was
started back after the patient was found to have blood sugars in
the 250 range.  He will be seen by his primary care doctor
shortly after discharge for further titration of meds.
.
2) UTI- The patient was started on IV ceftriaxone which would
cover both his UTI and balantitis.  Culture results were
negative.  The patient was discharged on PO Augmentin.
.
3) Balantitis- Patient was found to have balanitis after recent
circumcision approximately 2 weeks prior to this admission.  A
swab gram stain negative.  The wound culture was found to grown
Diptheroids (Corynebacterium) and Coag Negative Staph consistent
with skin floral.  The patient was continued on a topical
antifungal as well as IV Ceftriaxone.  Additionally, a DFA was
negative for HSV.  The patient was discharged on PO Augmentin
and will followup with his [**Hospital1 2025**] Urologist.
.
4) Thrombocytopenia:  Thought to be [**1-26**] drug effect of
voriconazole vs. ranitidine; however, per PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 2025**], he has had
baseline thrombocytopenia.  Thrombocytopenia has been mentioned
as a rare side effect of vori, but per ID's assessment of risks
vs. benefits, would not stop Voriconazole.  At [**Hospital1 18**], patient's
ranitidine was stopped to see what effect it would have on
platelets.  Patient's platelets rose from 60s-80s at baseline to
112, making Ranitidine a possible cause of the patient's
thrombocytopenia.  The patient was instructed not to take
Ranitidine anymore.  He will followup at [**Hospital1 2025**] for further
monitoring of his thrombocytopenia.
.
5) Pulmunary aspergillosis- The patient was continued on
lifelong voriconazole therapy for history of pulmonary
aspergillosis.
.
6) Thrush- Patient was thought to have evidence of oral thrush
upon admission to the MICU.  He was continued on voriconazole
and nystatin S&S was added to his regimen.  He had no further
evidence of thrush upon transfer to the floor from the MICU.
.
7) Afib/SSS- Has PPM but currently native sinus driven.  The
patient was anticoagulated with warfarin.  Flecainide was
continued as per his outpatient regimen.
.
8) S/P renal xplant- Patient was continued on his
immunosupressives, Tacrolimus.  He was continued on Bactrim for
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  He will followup with his renal doctor at [**Hospital3 5870**] upon discharge.
