Brief Hospital Course:
63 y/o female s/p liver transplant sent home on tube feeds who
returns with electrolyte derangements and an elevated Prograf
level.
On admission her sodium was noted to be 119 and she was started
on normal saline. In addition her creatinine was 1.6 which was
double her baseline value.
Over the next three days we continued to hydrate her and the
labs normalized significantly.
Tube feeds were reinstated.
She received counseling regarding the lasrge amount of free
water she was apparently drinking at home and medications were
reviewed as well to assure compliance especially with the
immunosuppression regimen.
She made an excellent recovery. The alk phos remained slightly
elevated but all other LFTs trended back or were normal. There
was discussion of further testing but it was determined at this
time that no other tests were required and she was sent home
still on tube feeds which are now being cycled as she did well
with the cycle trial initiated on this admission.
