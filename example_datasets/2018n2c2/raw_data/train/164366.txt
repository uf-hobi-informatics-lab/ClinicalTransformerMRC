Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea, vomiting, fever, fatigue.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Subclavian Line Placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] is a 50 year old man with HIV on HAART (CD4 count of
589 [**2104-9-24**]) and CAD who presented to the ED with nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, fevers, chills, pruritis and
abdominal pain. Patient had a dental visit today and took
antibiotic prophylaxis (amoxicillin). Shortly after, he
developed symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills.


In the ED his initial temperature was 98.7 with HR of 102, BP
91/61, O2 sat 97% RA. Abdominal CT showed no diverticulitis or
appendicitis. While in the ED he developed a temperature of
102.2 with HR of 110, BP 84/47, O2 sat 100%. Lactate was 4.9.
Patient received ceftriaxone 2 gm, vancomycin and flagyl. After
4 liters of normal saline his BP was 86/63, temp 100.4, HR 107.
He had several episodes of watery diarrhea. LP was performed
which showed no signs of infection. He was started on the sepsis
protocol and received a total of 6L of NS with 1000 cc of urine
output. Patient was started on levophed and it was titrated to
0.05 mcg/kg/min for a bp of 90/42 with a MAP 59. CVP was 9, SVO2
83%.

In the ICU, he initially required pressors to maintain his blood
pressure but his hemodynamics quickly stabilized so that he did
not require pressors or IV fluids.  On [**10-19**] he was afebrile
with stable vitals on po levofloxacin and he was transferred to
the medical floor.  On transfer he endorsed continued fatigue
and nausea but felt subjectively much better and specifically
denied fevers, chills, sweats, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal
pain, or dysuria.


Past Medical History:
1. HIV (CD4 count of 589 [**2104-9-24**])

[**2102-1-7**], with stenting of the LAD.
3. Dyslipidemia.
4. Peptic ulcer disease.
5. Low back pain.

7. History of abnormal LFTs with repeat normal LFTs.
8. Depression.

Pertinent cardiac studies:
[**9-8**]- cardiac cath
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Patent LAD stent.
*focal 80% stenosis is the mid PDA that upon review, did not
appear significantly worse than on his previous catheterization
of 1/[**2101**].

ECHO [**1-10**]:
EF 50% , E:A 1.2
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of
the distal inferior wall and distal half of the anterior septum
and apex. The remaining segments contract well. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but not stenotic. There is no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] is a 50 year old man with HIV, CAD, and HTN who
presented with nausea, vomting, diarrhea, weakness, fevers,
chills, pruritis and abdominal pain. He initially required
pressors and IV fluids to support his blood pressure.

1) SIRS:
His presentation with fever, tachycardia, hypotension and an
elevated lactate was thought to be consistent with SIRS.  The
etiology of his SIRS was unclear as his infectious workup was
largely negative with the exception of a potential LLL
pneumonia.  It was thought that this was most likely due to an
anaphylactic reaction to amoxicillin as on further questioning
he endorsed pruritis, facial erythema/edema, and that these
symptoms felt quite similar to an anaphylactic exposure to
bactrim he had several years ago.  Regardless of the etiology he
quickly improved in terms of hemodynamics and lactate level.  He
was continued on levofloxacin and given a prescription to
complete a seven day course to finish on [**2104-10-23**].

2) Abdominal pain/diarrhea/vomiting:
This was thought to be part of his SIRS process and generally
improved during his hospitalization.  A CT scan was negative for
an infectious or inflammatory process.  He still complained of
slight nausea at discharge and was given a prescription for
compazine to use as needed.

3) HIV: He was continued on his HAART regimena and will follow
up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

4) CAD/HTN:
His anti-hypertensives were initially held due to his
hypotension.  At discharge his blood pressure was stable in the
110-150/50-80 range.  At discharge he was restarted on atenolol
at 25 mg daily.  He has a follow-up appointment in [**Company 191**] on
[**2104-9-22**] and at this time he should have his blood pressure
checked and medications adjusted if needed (he was previously
taking metoprolol 50 mg and lisinopril 5 mg).  He was continued
on his aspirin.

5) Hyperlipidemia:
He was restarted on his pravastatin at discharge.
