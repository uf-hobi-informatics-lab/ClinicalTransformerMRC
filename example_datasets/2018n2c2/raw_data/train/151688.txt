Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**]
Chief Complaint:
Metastatic brain lesions

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**9-23**]: Right parietal Craniotomy for Mass resection


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 77 yo woman with PMHx sig. for breast cancer
diagnosed in [**11/2098**] s/p chemotherapy followed by Herceptin who
presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with seizures, was found to have
metastatic brain lesion, and transferred for XRT of metastatic
brain lesions.

Patient had a PET scan in [**8-20**] that was normal except a low
attenuation lesion in R parietal lobe.  Outpatient brain MRI on
[**2100-9-17**] showed 1.2 cm right parietal mass with extensive edema
c/w sole metastasis.

On Sunday evening, she presented with new seizures.  The
patient's son was sitting with her when she began to have
jerking of her left arm.  She recalls that her arm was
"trembling" and then she cannot recall any further events.  She
then developed slurred speech and L facial droop.  She was taken
to the ED, where she was agitated and confused.  She received
ativan 4 mg, phenytoin loading, and dexamethason 6 mg IV.  She
was seen by Neurology and Oncology, who felt that the patient
would be candidate for gamma knife or neurosurgical removal
followed by XRT.  She is transferred for evaluation of these
treatments.  She has had no seizures since being hospitalized at
[**Location (un) **].  She did receive at 8 AM on [**2100-9-20**] for agitation.
She also received dilantin IV and Decadron IV.  Vitals prior to
transfer were:  97.4 124/66 65 20 100% on 5L.

History was confirmed by her HCP/son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 88500**].

Review of Systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, vision problems, gait problems
dysarthria.  Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.

OSH Imaging:
[**2100-9-7**], PET CT:  No abnormal FDG-Avid abnormalities to suggest
recurrent or metastatic idsease.  Not previously localized focus
of low attenuation which is partially seen in the high posterior
right parietal lobe.

[**2100-9-17**], MRI brain with or without contrast:  1.2 cm R parietal
intraparenchymal enhancing mass with extensive vasogenic edema
is hgih suspicious for metastatic neoplasm.  The lesion is
located with the post central gyrus and edema extends to the
motor cortex.  There is no associated sig. midline shift or
downward herniation.

[**2100-9-19**], head CT without contrast:  Area of hypoattenuation in
the R post central gyrus with a nodular focus of hyperdensity.

[**2100-9-19**], CXR:  Limited study not including portions of the
lower lobes with suggestion of cardiomegaly without failure.

MRI Brain [**9-24**]
Right posterior frontal/parietal 2-cm lesion at the surface of
the brain, likely dural-based metastatic lesions. Surrounding
edema is seen.  No midline shift or hydrocephalus. No change in
appearance

[**9-25**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Right frontoparietal post-surgical
changes with small amount of blood products and focus of air
within the post-surgical cavity with surrounding vasogenic
edema. Pneumocephalus over the right frontal lobe.  Mild right
cerebral hemispheric edema with effacement of the sulci. No
midline shift.

[**9-25**] Head MRI: IMPRESSION: Limited study with no
post-gadolinium T1 images obtained for assessment of residual
mass. No diffusion images. Blood products and postoperative
changes in the right parietal region are as expected. For better
assessment, consider repeat gadolinium study.

[**9-27**] Head CT /c contrast: IMPRESSION:
1. Post-surgical changes, similar in appearance with small
amount of
hemorrhagic products, edema and pneumocephalus as expected. No
new hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures. 2. No
definite abnormal enhancement. Please note that MRI is more
sensitive for detection of residual disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo woman with PMHx sig. for breast cancer diagnosed in
[**11/2098**] s/p chemotherapy followed by Herceptin who presented to
[**Hospital **] Hospital with seizures, was found to have metastatic
brain lesion, and transferred for XRT of metastatic brain
lesions.
.
# Metastatic breast cancer to the brain/Seizure: The patient was
continued on decadron and phenytoin with a therapeutic level.
She was seen by the neuro-oncology service, neurosurgery
service, and the radiation oncology service. After long
discussion with her two sons, the patient opted for
neurosurgical treatment of her solitary brain metastasis and was
transferred on the neurosurgery service on [**Hospital Ward Name **] on [**9-23**].
An initial speech and swallowing study obtained while the
patient was recommended soft solids.
.
# Encephalopathy, metabolic:  The patient was initially
extremely lethargic, although arousable and able to follow
commands, which was thought to be secondary to the large doses
of ativan that she received for her seizure. By the second
hospital day the patient's mental status was completely back to
baseline and she remained oriented and interactive.
.
# Acute renal failure:
- IVFs
- monitor Cr

The patient was trasnferred to the neurosurgery service on the
evening of [**9-23**] from the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] in order to undergo
surgical resection of her brain mass. She had an MRI WAND study
overnight on [**9-23**] for surgical planning with plan for OR [**9-24**]
am. On the morning of [**9-24**] she was brought to the pre-op area
however her case had to be reshceduled for the evening.  She
remained stable on the floor while awaiting her operation.
Surgery was performed without complication. She was admitted to
the ICU post op for close neurological monitoring. The patient's
post-operative neurologic examination remained unchanged.
Post-op MRI revealed no evidence of new CVA or residual tumor.

On [**9-25**]- [**9-27**] she was neurologically stable. She was cleared
for transfer to the floor. Post operative imaging was performed
which revealed post operative changes and no hemorrhage. PT and
OT were consulted and recommended discharge to a rehab facility.

On [**9-28**] she was cleared for discharge to rehab facility pending
bed availability.
