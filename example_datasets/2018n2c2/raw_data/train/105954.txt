Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3223**]
Chief Complaint:
On admission: Mr [**Known lastname 79336**] states that he experienced two to three
months of abdominal discomfort, which grew in severity and
became more constant.  He had a simultaneous loss of appetite,
although he denies nausea or emesis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2147-10-12**] - s/p subtotal gastrectomy w/Bilroth II reconstruction,
transverse colectomy, feeding J tube placement


History of Present Illness:
On [**9-6**], the patient underwent a barium upper GI series.
This study demonstrated a large ulcerated mass associated with
the greater curve of the stomach in the distal portion.  On
[**9-8**], upper endoscopy was performed, with the finding of
a large ulcerated antral mass.  Upon biopsy, he has been
considered to have an invasive adenocarcinoma of the signet ring
type.

On [**9-13**], a CT scan of the torso was obtained.  He was
described as having a 4-mm right pulmonary lobe nodule.  There
was a 6-mm hypodense lesion in segment III of the liver.  A 7.5
cm mass was seen in association with the greater curve of the
stomach within the antrum.  There did appear to be some
stranding or nodularity in the greater omentum extending towards
the transverse colon, although there was no clear-cut
involvement of the transverse colon.  There did not appear to be
any significant retroperitoneal adenopathy.

Past Medical History:
HTN
Hypercholesterolemia
Arthritis

Social History:
Mr [**Known lastname 79336**] is a 68-year-old retired factory worker from the food
industry

He has a history of heavy cigarette smoking, one pack per day
for 25
years, stopping in [**2146-10-24**].


Family History:
The family history is significant for a brain tumor in his
mother.  [**Name (NI) **] believes that his brother died at age 12 from
leukemia but he was uncertain.

Physical Exam:

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent the above procedure on [**10-12**].  He tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred to the surgical floor,
with a foley catheter in place, NG tube in place, J tube to
gravity, PCA for pain control, his diet remained NPO, IVF for
hydration.  He received 3 doses of peri-operative antibiotics.

[**10-14**] - Tube feeds were started at 1/2 strength at 10cc/hour, NGT
discontinued

[**10-16**] - transferred to the ICU for tachycardia, oxygen
desaturations.  CTA performed showing no pulmonary embolism.
ECHO performed showing moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with global normal systolic function and mildly
dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis.

[**10-17**] - respiratory status was stable. Had bilious emesis twice
and began burping. Tube feeds were held and pt was made NPO.

[**10-18**]- TPN started, NPO continued. UGI study showed ileus.

[**10-19**] - Transferred to the surgical floor, continued NPO, TPN,
NGT and foley catheter in place, TF at 20 cc/hr

[**10-20**] - transferred to the TSICU for continued respiratory
distress, transfused one unit RBC

[**10-21**] - Zosyn started for blood cultures positive for GNR,
central line removed

[**10-22**] - central line replaced, vancomycin started

[**10-23**] - CT guided drainage of right and left abdominal fluid
collections, drains left in place to gravity, flagyl added

[**10-24**] - cont TPN, TF at full strength at 60, started fluconazole
for yeast in left abdminal drain, transfused 2 units RBC

[**10-25**] - Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] recommended possible re-exploration for a
presumed abscess.  He indicated to the family that there was no
evidence of any actual anastamotic dehischence from any of the
imaging studies. However, after extensive discussions, per the
patient and family requests, the patient was made comfort
measures only.  All antibiotics, tube feeds, and extraneous
means of support were removed.  The patient was transferred to
the surgical floor

[**10-26**] - Palliative Care consulted. Adjustments made to pain
medication regimen.

[**10-29**] - Pt expires at 12:20 PM. Immediate cause of death is
respiratory arrest
