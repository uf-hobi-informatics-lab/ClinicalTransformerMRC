History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 43 yo Thai speaking male with ESRD on HD, HTN
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-26**] after being notified that blood
cultures drawn on [**6-24**] returned positive for GPC in [**1-28**] bottles.
He arrived to HD on [**6-24**] with rigors and chills, but was
afebrile to 99.1, and had blood cx's drawn. On arrival to the
ED, he was afebrile to 96.8, with BP 92/38, and was admitted to
medicine for further work-up. He was given 1g vanco x1, 1 g
ceftaz x1, which were continued on the floor. ROS were negative
for any fever, cough, SOB, dysuria, odynophagia or any other
localizing symptoms. It was felt that his tunneled HD line was
likely the source, and it was planned to have that line removed.
Pt was dialyzed on [**6-26**] through his still maturing AVF in his L
arm.
On [**6-27**], pt became increasingly hypotensive, with BPs at 80/40.
He was otherwise afebrile to 97.8, but Tmax 100.3, with HR 70s,
RR 20s, and satting 100% on RA. He was given 1L NS bolus without
improvement in his blood pressure. Pt was transferred to the ICU
for closer monitoring. He was transferred to the floor after he
was hemodynamically stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 43 yo male with history of ESRD [**1-28**] HTN presents
with high-grade bacteremia with 2/2 bottles of pansensitive
Enterococcus and Enterobacter and 4/4 bottles of GNR.

1. Enterococcal/Enterobacter bacteremia: Patient with
polymicrobial bacteremia secondary to infected tunneled HD line;
no other localizing symptoms on admission. Initially hypotensive
with BPs in 80/40's consistent with sepsis. He was transferred
to the MICU for closer management, no pressors were required.
His tunneled HD Line was pulled and he was started on Vancomycin
and Levaquin, as per ID.  He also had been on Ceftaz,
Meperidine, and Linezolid, all of which were stopped in the
MICU. TTE was done and did not suggest any vegetations or
abcesses. TEE was then done and showed a moderate sized aortic
vegetation that was consistent with aortic regurgitation, which
was auscultated on exam. Patient was seen by CT surgery and felt
that he would require AVR after he had completed his 6 week
course of antibiotics and suggested he undergo cardiac
catheterization as part of the pre-op evaluation. Patient was
also seen by cardiology was consulted Vancomycin was changed to
Ampicillin, as per ID, who felt that Enterococcus was more
sensitive to this drug. Two weeks later he became neutropenic,
developed a diffuse erythematous rash, and started spiking
temperatures.
