History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86yo woman with h/o recent stroke who was
transferred from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] after being found to have a low
hematocrit. There was no reported bleeding and she was without
complaint. Per review of notes in the chart, there was no
preceeding diarrhea or vomiting. She does not have any
endoscopies or colonoscopies in the [**Hospital1 **] record.  Pt denies abd
pain but hx limited by her aphasia/non-verbal status.  Per PCP
and family, [**Name9 (PRE) 79134**] invasive treatment/work-up is preferred as
long as there is no significant GI bleed.
.
She was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where her VS were stable, Hct 17.4,
and she was noted to have guaiac +, formed, brown stool.  Coags
wnl at 1.2.  Also had sodium 151, which has since resolved w/
D5W IF.  Pt was given 2uRBCs, including that given in MICU. She
spent 1 day in MICU where her Hct bumped back to 17.4->27.7 o/n.
She was seen by GI who recommended conservative rx w/ PPI and
prn transfusions.

Hemolysis labs: calTIBC-334 Hapto-287* Ferritn-27 TRF-257

EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Borderline leftward axis. Possible prior
inferior
myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2172-9-8**] the findings are similar.

CXR: IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 86yo woman with dementia and h/o recent left MCA
stroke complicated by persistent aphasia and hemiparesis
admitted with acute hematocrit drop and guaiac positive stool.
.
# Anemia: Pt has chronic anemia w/ baseline Hct 25-27.
Hemolysis work-up was negative.  Acute drop in Hct was thought
to be from GI source.  Pt's Hct bumped appropriately with 2u RBC
transfusions, and she was monitored for 1 day in MICU, where she
remained hemodynamically stable.  GI was consulted, and given
her family's desire for minimal intervention, she was managed
conservatively with PPI, Hct checks, and PRN transfusions.  She
was also taken off ASA ppx for stroke, in setting of GIB.
Although labs do not show iron deficiency, she was supplemented
as she may continue to have GIB.  Her Hct remained stable at ~25
on day of discharge.  She should have her hematocrit checked on
the day after discharge.  Her hematocrit should be regularly
monitored afterwards according to her attending doctor's
discretion, but we would advise that another Hematocrit be
checked this [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**10-2**], and that she be transfused
as needed to keep her Hct at baseline ~ 25
.
# Hypernatremia:  Pt arrived with sodium of 153, which was
thought to be due to free water deficit from poor access to
water.  She was gently hydrated with D5W and her hypernatremia
resolved and has remained within normal range.
.
# Elevated troponin:  Patient unable to verbalize chest pain.
EKG does not show changes from prior tracing 3 weeks ago.  Her
troponin remained stable at 0.03 after 3 sets of enzymes.  She
was continued on home simvastatin.
.
# s/p Left MCA stroke: Continues to have significant aphasia and
right sided weakness.  Keppra was continued.  ASA was held in
setting of active bleed.
.
# HTN:  Remained HD stable throughout hospitalization with good
BP control.  Norvasc was held b/c of GI bleed, but discharge
instructions were to re-start her anti-hypertensive medications
at her long term care facility if she remained hemodynamically
stsable.
.
# h/o cataracts and glaucoma:  Pt was continued on levobunolol.
She was given xalatan eye drops instead of travatan due to
formulary issues.
.
# Heel ulcer: Stage 1 pressure ulcer was identified this
admission. The pt's legs were kept in waffle boots to minimize
pressure to this area.
.
# Code: DNR/DNI

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital3 1186**] - [**Location (un) 538**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
-Acute-on-chronic anemia with guaiac + stools and no further GI
work-up secondary to family's desire for minimal intervention
-Hypernatremia secondary to inability to take adequate water,
resolved with IV fluids
Secondary:
-s/p left MCA stroke with persistent hemiparesis and aphasia
-Left heel ulcer
-Alzheimer's dementia
-Hypertension
-History of glaucoma & cataracts

Discharge Condition:
Improved hematocrit, hemodynamically stable


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for an acute drop in your blood count. Your
blood count stabilized after 2 units of blood transfusion.  It
was thought that you are bleeding from your GI tract.  Because
your family desires minimal interventions, we plan to
conservatively treat your bleeding by monitoring your blood
count and giving transfusions on an as needed basis.

Please continue to have your blood count monitored at your
living facility.
