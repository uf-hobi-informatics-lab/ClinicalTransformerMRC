Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4365**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation in the field.

History of Present Illness:
73 year old man with history of COPD, hyperlipidemia, HTN who
presents to the ED intubated by paramedics after they were
called to his home for increasing SOB.  The details of the
events leading up to his intubation are not clear.  In
discussion with friend [**Name (NI) 73298**] [**Name (NI) **], she reports that [**Name (NI) 269**] came to
visit on [**12-19**] at which time he was reportedly "doing well" in
terms of his respiratory status.  Sometime after [**Month/Year (2) 269**] left,
however, pt. called [**Doctor First Name 73298**] and told her he needed help as he
could not breathe.  It was at that time that EMS was called.
There is no EMS record in paperwork from the ED, but per verbal
report from ED resident, pt was so SOB that he requested
intubation when EMS arrived to his home.  Although per verbal
s/o there was report that he never picked up steroids that were
prescribed on discharge, I am unable to find a record of
steroids having been prescribed during his last admission and
further upon discharge.  He was intubated at home and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.
.
Of note, he was admitted to the surgical service from
[**Date range (1) 21504**]/08 after presenting with abdominal pain/rectal
bleeding and progressive SOB.  He was intubated in emergency
room d/t increasing respiratory distress despite multiple nebs.
NGT tubes was placed with coffee grounds and he reportedly had
episodes of maroon stool  EGD was performed on [**12-2**] which showed
pyloric ulcers, but no e/o active bleeding.  He had subsequent
additional hct drop and EGD was repeated on [**12-13**] showing e/o
recently bleeding pyloric ulcer.  Ulcer was injected with epi
and endoclip was deployed unsuccessfully.  He received a total
of 8 units prbcs, 1 bag platelets, 1 unit FFP last on [**12-3**]
after which his hct remained stable without any further
bleeding.  He was continued on [**Hospital1 **] PPI and was treated for h.
pylori.  Although his respiratory failure was attributed to COPD
exacerbation, it does not appear that he received steroids
during his hospital stay.  He was, however, extubated
successfully and when ambulating with PT during last admission,
he became SOB with O2 sats dipping into the 80% and CTA was
positive for subsegmental PE and he was started on heparin gtt
and transitioned to coumadin prior to discharge.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.0 P 120 BP 95/77 Intubated and
breathing at set rate of 16 O2 sat100% on AC (exact settings
unclear). CTA chest on prelim read showed no PE, pneumonia or
edema; it showed unchanged pulmonary nodules.  UA showed few
bacteria, no squams, 6 WBCs, [**2-27**] RBCs.  He received 125mg IV
solumedrol, 1g IV ceftriaxone and 500mg IV azithromycin x1.  He
received versed for sedation.  He received a total of 6L NS.
.

Pertinent Results:
Images:
[**2143-12-20**] CTA chest (prelim):  No PE, pneumonia or edema.
Nodules unchanged from 9 days prior.
.
[**2143-12-11**] CTA chest:
1. Isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism in the right lower
lobe of uncertain clinical significance.
2. 5-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule for which a six-month
followup chest CT is recommended per Fleishner Society
guidelines. Attention should be paid to two 1- mm pulmonary
nodules in the right upper and right middle lobes at that time
as well.
3. Moderate to marked emphysema.
4. Left posterior diaphragmatic defect with adjacent atelectasis

.
[**1-2**] Spirometry:  Moderate to marked obstructive ventilatory
defect.  FEV1 of 0.96. Compared to the prior study of [**2141-8-11**]
there has been no significant change.
.
EKG:  No clear Ps, probable a. flutter at rate of 123.  Normal
axis.  Frequent PVCs.  Biphasic TWs in V5-V6.
.
[**2143-12-12**] TTE:  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2136-3-28**], at least mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension is now detected (32-35mmHg). The remaining findings
are similar with normal biventricular systolic function.

[**2143-12-21**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half
of the anterior septum and anterior walls, and apex. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45 %). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Distal
right ventricular hypokinesis. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2143-12-12**], the regional left ventricular
and right ventricular systolic dysfunciton is new and c/w
interim ischemia (mid LAD distribution).


Brief Hospital Course:
73 year old man with COPD (FEV1 0.96), HTN, hyperlipidemia and
recent GIB from PUD presents 2 days post discharge, intubated at
home by paramedics after c/o increasing dyspnea.

# Respiratory failure likely related to COPD exacurbation:
History surrounding intubation and presentation is largely
unknown as he does not come with EMS paperwork and friend listed
as contact is unaware of the details.  It appears that he had
been doing okay at home since his d/c on [**12-17**], but complained
to his friend over the phone that he needed help d/t increasing
SOB (which prompted EMS call).  Per verbal s/o from ED, he had
been prescribed prednisone upon discharge on [**12-17**] for COPD
exacerbation, but pt did not pick up prescription.  He was
intubated on presentation to the ED on last presentation as well
presumably thought d/t COPD exacerbation.  Was diagnosed with PE
on last admission by CTA on [**12-10**] ("Isolated subsegmental
pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe of uncertain clinical
significance").  He was on heparin and discharged on coumadin
for this finding and repeat CTA on this presentation does not
even comment on subsegmental PE on prelim read so seems very
unlikely to be causing clinical presentation.  No e/o volume
overload nor of pneumonia on CT chest and unable to obtain hx
re: cough/sputum production. The patient was given IV steroids
which was subsequently trasitioned to oral prednisone with
[**Doctor Last Name 2949**]. He was continued on standing MDIs and was given
azithromycin. Sputum and blood cultures were no growth to date.


# Hypotension:  Normally hypertensive at baseline.  Presented
with SBPs in the 90s where he has largely remained stable
despite 6L IVFs.  Unclear etiology. Infection suspected
initially but his UA was unremarkable and his CT of chest
without e/o infiltrate. No other signs of infection were
evident.  [**Month (only) 116**] be partially med related (fentanyl/versed).  His
SBPs improved during the hospitalization and remained stable
without IVF.

# PE:  On [**12-10**] CTA chest showed small subsegmental PE for which
he was heparinized then transitioned to coumadin for discharge.
INR has been therapeutic and repeat CTA today with prelim report
showing no PE.  Goal INR per d/c summary was 2-2.5 given recent
GIB; INR currently 2.7. Anticoagulation was continued during
this admission.

# Positive cardiac biomarkers:  With elevated CK and MB although
neg MB index; troponin positive at 0.30.  Trop could be up in
setting of PE, but PE on last admission seems so small
(subsegmental) that it is unlikely to be the underlying cause of
his hypoxia and positive trop.  EKG did show probable a.flutter
with rate in the 120s so demand ischemia possible. Continued
statin and ASA; holding BB given relative hypotension.
Cardiology saw the patient and recomended outpatient follow up.

# PUD and recent UGIB:  Serology positive for H. pylori.  It
appears that he was initiated on amoxacillin and clarithromycin
on [**12-4**] and thus, should have completed a full 2 week course at
this time. We continued [**Hospital1 **] PPI and sucralfate

# A. fib/flutter:  EKG from [**12-16**] shows a. fib.  Does not appear
to have diagnsosis of this prior to that.  CHADS2 score of [**12-27**]
with HTN and age nearly >75.  He is currently anticoagulated and
INR is therapeutic.

# Lung nodule:  5-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule on [**12-10**]
CT chest for which a six-month recommended.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with an exacurbation of your COPD. You
required intubation for a brief period and were treated with
antibiotics, steroids, neulizers and oxygen. You are being
discharged on steroid medication (prednisone) as well as a
medication to help with your cough (guainefesin). While you are
on steroids, you should take sucralfate. You should continue
Albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, Flovent and Spiriva.

We also noted that your heart exhibited some abnormalities which
we believe are a consequence of your rapid heart rate. We gave
you medications to slow your heard down. We have arranged an
appointment with a heart doctor on an outpatient basis. Also we
have scheduled for you to have a stress test to evaluate your
heart.

We made changes in your blood thining medication (coumadin) and
you are to follow up with a nurse practitioner in the
[**Hospital3 **] in order to have this medication
monitored. Also your visiting nurse can help with this. You
should not take coumadin today because your level was slightly
elevated.

We gave you a new medication to take for your blood pressure
(amlodipine) so now you should take metoprolol, lisinopril and
amlodipine for blood pressure.

Please call your regular doctor or return to the ED if you
experience shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations,
lightheadedness or any other symptom that concerns you. Also be
aware that the blood thining medication places you at risk for
bleeding.
