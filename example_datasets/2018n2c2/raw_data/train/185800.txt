cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
63 year old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis and HCC,
osteoporosis, ovarian cysts, active smoker for 40 years, who
presented to OR for elective RFA as outpatient today and was
found to be hypotensive and bradycardic after administration of
sedatives for intubation.  She underwent induction for
anesthesia with propofol, succ, rocuronium, fentanyl with blood
pressure dropping from the systolic 90s to 60s.  HRs also
subsequently dropped to 30s.  She received glycopyrolate with
HRs recovering to 100s; she then received esmolol to decrease
HR.  Blood pressure currently in 80s-90s prior to transport to
MICU.  ECG showed ST depressions in V3-6.  Cardiology was
consulted in the PACU who felt that ST depressions were likely
[**1-19**] demand ischemia from hypotension.  Repeat EKGs showed
resolution of ST depressions.

RFA was postponed given her hypotension and bradycardia.  She
received a total of 2.5L LR and neosynephrine approximately
every 1/2hour for 3 doses.  She also received 1gm iv cefazolin.

.
On arrival to the MICU, pt reports feeling well.  Denies chest
pain, SOB, palpitations, lightheadedness, headache.  States that
she was in her usual state of health prior to coming in for
procedure today.  Took one of her alprazolam 0.25mg last night.
Has not eaten for procedure today.

IMAGING
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2102-4-12**]:
PRE-PROCEDURE IMAGING: Limited unenhanced CT scan of the abdomen
which
demonstrated a macro-nodular contour of the liver with mild
segmental atrophy in segment V consistent with known cirrhosis.
The spleen is enlarged. There is no ascites. The known segment
VIII liver lesion measuring 2.1 x 1.9 cm is redemonstrated as a
hypodense lesion (2:14). The segment VI lesion is not well
appreciated on non-contrast CT. The lung bases demonstrate
bilateral dependent atelectasis and mild middle lobe
atelectasis. The heart is normal in size.

PROCEDURE:

The procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed
with the
patient and written informed consent was obtained during a
preprocedure
interventional radiology consultation. The consent was reviewed
prior to the procedure. A preprocedure timeout was performed
discussing the planned
procedure, confirming the patient's identity with three
identifiers, and
reviewing a checklist per [**Hospital1 18**] protocol.

Under ultrasound guidance, an entrance site was selected and the
skin was
prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.

The patient underwent induction of general anesthesia for the
procedure.
After prepping the patient, and prior to beginning the
procedure, the anesthesiologist noted ST depression on the
monitor and the procedure was put on hold. A 12-lead EKG was
performed, and based upon these findings, a stat cardiology
consult was requested. The procedure was terminated, and general
anesthesia was reversed.

For information on general anesthesia course/medications
administered, please see anesthesia notes. For further
information regarding the cardiac event, please see cardiology
consultation and inpatient medical records.

IMPRESSION:

Cancelation of ultrasound/CT-guided radiofrequency ablation
secondary to
cardiac event during induction of general anesthesia. Cardiology
consultation has been performed. The patient will be admitted
for observation.
.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT Study Date of
[**2102-4-12**]:
FINDINGS:
Limited ultrasound of the abdomen was performed prior to
beginning the
procedure. Segment VIII liver lesion is visualized under
ultrasound guidance. The segment VI lesion was poorly
visualized. The planned radiofrequency ablation was terminated
prior to beginning the procedure secondary to a cardiac event.
Please see details dictated under CT interventional procedure
#[**Numeric Identifier 110214**].

IMPRESSION:

Limited ultrasound guidance for planned radiofrequency ablation
as above.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2102-4-13**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 60%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The number
of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2102-4-13**]
FINDINGS: There are bilateral basilar opacities, with some
element of
organization likely representing subacute pneumonia. The upper
lung zones are clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
effusion. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is normal.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities with organization, likely
subacute pneumonia.

PRELIMINARY REPORT***
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically-apparant flow limiting coronary
artery
disease.  The LMCA was short but widely patent.  The LAD gave
off modest
calibur diagnoals with a hinge point in D1.  The LAD had a 20%
ostial
lesion, and mild luminal irregularities leading into a 40%
proximal-mid
tubular lesion. There was a possible intramyocardial segment of
the LAD
distally, and the distal LAD wrapped around the apex. The LAD
had
slightly slow flow consistent with mild microvascular
dysfunction.  The
LCX was widely patent and supplied a large OM2, a large calibur
OM4/LPL,
a small LPL2, and a large left PDA.  There Lcx had slightly slow
flow
consistent with mild microvascular dysfunction.  The RCA was a
small and
non-dominant vessel free of angiographically-apparant flow
limiting
coronary artery disease.
2. Limted resting hemodynamics revealed a normal systemic
arterial blood
presure of 128/68 mmHg, and a mildly elevated LVEDP of 22 mmHg.
There
was no gradient with careful pullback across the aortic valve.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically-apparant flow limiting coronary artery
disease,
with evidence of some athersclerosis and slightly slow flow
consistent
with microvascular dysfunction.
2. Moderate left ventricular diastolic heart failure.
3. Medical therapy for coronary artery disease with aspirin,
betablocker, statin, smoking cessasion, risk factor reduction.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 year old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis and HCC,
osteoporosis, ovarian cysts, active smoker for 40 years, who
presented to OR for elective RFA as outpatient today and was
found to be hypotensive and bradycardic after administration of
sedatives for intubation. Her EKG was concerning for ST
depressions in the setting of hypotension, with a troponin
elevation, so patient underwent cardiac catheterization with no
angiographical flow limiting disease.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Hypotension: Pt was found to be hypotensive as low as systolic
60s, likely secondary to medications for induction.  Per PACU
notes, she received propofol, succ, rocuronium, fentanyl; she
was subsequently treated with IVFs, glycopyrrolate, and
neosynephrine with BP subsequently rising to 80s-90s.  Volume
depletion was  likely another contributing factor as pt had been
NPO since night prior to procedure and was fluid responsive in
PACU. She received additional fluid boluses in the ICU, but
still required dopamine temporarily overnight following her
procedure. She was quickly weaned off and she maintained her
blood pressure in the 90's-100's systolic afterwards.
.
# Bradycardia: This was also thought to be likely from agents
given for induction, particularly propofol and  succinylcholine.
 She also received esmolol after she became tachycardic from
glycopyrrolate.  Her bradycardia resolved over 24 hours.
.
# ST depressions: EKG showed ST depressions in lead V3-V6 that
were new from prior, in setting of bradycardia and hypotension.
Her repeat EKG later showed resolution of ST depressions.  Pt
was evaluated by cardiology who felt that ST depressions were
likely from demand ischemia from hypotension and bradycardia.
She had a troponin elevation to Trop elevated to 0.32 with mild
MB elevation to 8. Given that the patient is being evaluated for
transplantation, she underwent a cardiac catheterization which
revealed non significant coronary artery disease. She also had a
TTE which showed EF >55%, trace AR and MR.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# HCC: Pt with HCV cirrhosis that is well-compensated (Childs
[**Doctor Last Name 14477**] A).  She has no history of jaundice, encephalopathy,
ascites, or esophageal varices.  She will need to have her RFA
rescheduled and will require an anesthesia evaluation prior to
the procedure.
.
# Osteoporosis: continued home raloxifene, calcium and vitamin D
.
# Tobacco abuse: Pt was supplied a nicotine patch while in
hospital
.
Transitional Issues:
# blood cultures were pending at time of discharge.
.
# Pt's initial chest xray was concerning for pneumonia, however
pt was clinically well and asymptomatic. No antibiotics were
started but would have low threshold to initiate treatment for
pneumonia if pt develops symptoms.
.
# Pt will need to have her RFA rescheduled. She should have a
pre-op evaluation by anesthesia to determine the safety of the
procedure.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 32687**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**]. You were admitted for a radiofrequency ablation,
but had complications from the anesthesia so the procedure was
stopped. You required a short ICU stay for low blood pressure
and a slow heart rate. However, your blood pressure and heart
rate returned to [**Location 213**]. You had a heart catheterization to
evaluate for any blockages in the heart, and this was normal.

We have made no changes to your medications.
