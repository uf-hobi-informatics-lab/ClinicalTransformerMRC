History of Present Illness:
58 year-old female, 60 pack-year smoker, with dyspnea,
hoarseness, and cough x1 month admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] SICU [**2172-8-25**]
after found to have large mediastinal mass, today found to be
poorly-differentiated carcinoma, suspected small cell. On
initial evaluation, patient was found to have 3mm opening of
distal trachea secondary to external compression from
mediastinal mass, RUL mass, RUL collapse, and clinical findings
consistent with SVC sydrome. Y-stent was placed that evening, in
addition to Pigtail catheter for right-sided effusion. Patient
remained intubated following surgery, on paralytics due to
low-lying ET tube and small volume bleeding after endobronchial
biopsy. On [**2172-8-26**], extubated was attempted. Patient was
reintubated within 10 minutes due to neurological
unresponsiveness, hypoxia (O2 saturation 80s), and hemodynamic
instability. She was found to have a right pneumothorax, which
improved with subsequent placement of chest tube. Patient was
also noted to have pericardial effusion; given absence of
physiologic tamponade, cardiology decided against
pericardiocentesis.
.
Hospital course also complicated by hyponatremia on admission
(Na 118) attributed to SIADH and improved with fluid restriction
(Na 126). Also with hypotension (sBP 90s) following reintubation
on [**2172-8-26**]. Given hyperkalemia, hyponatremia adrenal
insufficiency was suspected; evaluated by endocrine team who
recommended stress dose steroids pending further evaluation of
etiology of hypotension. Also with non-anion gap metabolic
acidosis, transient hypothermia (T 95 [**2172-8-26**]) of unknown
etiology.
.
Per report, patient has done well today. She remains intubated,
on pressure support. Given the above pathology results, patient
is transferred to the medical ICU ([**Hospital Ward Name 332**]) for radiation
therapy.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital 332**] medical ICU, patient is intubated,
sedated, and unable to provide history.

.
Imaging:
[**8-25**] CT Chest without contrast:
1. Large mediastinal mass causes narrowing of the right
pulmonary artery, superior vena cava, and trachea and occlusion
of the pulmonary artery supplying the right upper lobe in
addition to the right upper lobe bronchus. These findings are
most concerning for a primary lung carcinoma.
2. Right upper lobe collapse with nonenhancing lung parenchyma.
Tumor involvement cannot be excluded. Atelectasis of the right
lower and middle lobe.
3. Large right pleural effusion.
.
[**8-25**] Tracheal mass tissue pathology:
Immunohistochemical studies show that tumor cells are positively
stained by TTF-1 and CK7; they are negative for CK20,
chromogranin, and synaptophysin.  The tumor shows areas of
necrosis, extensive apoptosis and focal lymphatic vascular
invasion; some areas  the tumor cell size approaching that of a
small cell carcinoma, but much of the tumor has larger nuclei.
Overall, the tumor probably fits into the spectrum of a small
cell carcinoma of lung.
.
[**8-26**] Pleural fluid cytology:
Rare groups of epithelioid cells, too few to characterize
further. By immunohistochemistry: mesothelial cells stain for
calretinin and WT-1. Epithelial markers [**Last Name (un) **]-31, CEA, and B72.3
are negative. Rare cells are highlighted by TTF-1; however,
these cells are not cytologically atypical and may represent
non-specific reactivity.
.
[**8-26**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Low QRS voltage in limb leads. No
previous tracing available for comparison.
.
[**8-26**] Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is a small to moderate sized, primarily
anterior pericardial effusion without right ventricular
diastolic collapse. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.
Mild-moderate, primarily anterior pericardial effusion. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function.
If clinically indicated, a follow-up study is suggested.
.
[**8-27**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with and without contrast:
1. Vascular findings unchanged from [**2172-8-25**]. Narrowing of SVC
and left
brachiocephalic vein by large mediastinal mass. The SVC is
narrowed to
approximately 5 mm over a region extending 3 cm in craniocaudal
dimension.
Indirect evidence of right brachiocephalic vein occlusion,
likely complete. Unchanged narrowing of right pulmonary artery.
Splayed but patent aortic arch branches.
2. Interval decrease in large right pleural effusion, with small
anterior
pneumothorax. Right chest tube terminating at apex.
3. No interval change in large infiltrative hypoattenuating
right
hilar/mediastinal mass.
4. No evidence of metastases in the abdomen or pelvis. Slightly
bulky left
adrenal gland without discrete nodule or mass.
5. Anasarca and small amount of peritoneal fluid collecting in
the pelvis,
likely related to edema.
6. Interval tracheal stenting with improved caliber of airway.
.
[**2172-8-27**] ECHO: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2172-8-26**], the size of the pericardial effusion is unchanged
with no signs of tamponade. The left ventricle seems to be
underfilled.
.
[**8-28**] CT Head:
1. Within limits of this modality, no evidence of enhancing mass
or edema to suggest metastatic disease.
2. Status post bilateral frontal craniotomy and probable
aneurysm clipping
with encephalomalacic changes in the right frontotemporal and
left temporal lobes. No evidence of acute hemorrhage or infarct.

3. Probable chronic bifrontal subdural hygromas with minimal
mass effect on the subjacent frontal gyri; these may relate to
the extensive remote surgery
.
[**2172-9-2**] CT Head (performed due to worsened mental status):
1. Unchanged examination from recent exam of [**2172-8-28**].
2. Status post bilateral frontal craniotomies with aneurysm
clipping and
encephalomalcia, as described above. No evidence of acute
hemorrhage or
infarct.
.
[**2172-9-3**] Renal US:
1. Mildly echogenic kidneys consistent with medical renal
disease. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, stone, or mass.
2. The left kidney remains atrophic and lobulated, similar to
[**2172-8-27**].
.
[**2172-9-4**] CT Chest w/o contrast (to evaluate tumor s/p XRT and
chemo for future XRT sessions):
1. Right anterior pneumothorax has resolved.
2. Mixed response of the tumor to radiotherapy with a decrease
of the central component of the tumor and a mixed response of
the peripheral tumor components:
3. The peripheral consolidations in the right upper lobe have
overall
decreased in size, however, a new cavitary lesion has formed
measuring 11 x 19 mm.
4. The peripheral consolidations in the right lower lobe and
left lower lobe have increased in size, number and density and
may be part of post-
obstructive, post-radiotherapy, post-infectious, or acute
inflammatory
changes.
5. Lymphangio-carcinomatosis in the right upper lobe.
6. There is new small right pleural effusion and increased
moderate left
pleural effusion.
7. Left adrenal gland mass is only partially visualized in this
study.
.
[**2172-9-3**] EEG: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the very
disorganized and slow background rhythms. This suggests a
widespread and moderately severe encephalopathy in both cortical
and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances,
and infection are among the most common causes. Although there
were fleeting asymmetries, there was no reliable area of focal
slowing. Encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There are
some sharp features, but no clearly epileptiform abnormalities
and no electrographic seizures.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course [**Date range (3) 84902**]
58F with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC
syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial
effusion, resolved pleural effusion and pneumothorax, and
electrolytes disturbances admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for radiation
decompression therapy and chemotherapy. Pt developed respiratory
failure and renal failure.
.
#. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt was initially transferred
from SICU to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on CPAP/PS. She developed increasing
respiratory failure and was changed to AC mode.  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
she underwent XRT x2 and then chemotherapy for 3 days. Increased
hypoxia may have been due to pneumothorax, which resolved,
pleural effusions, atelectasis, possible VAP, tumor compression.
During hypoxic episodes, pt underwent bronchoscopy twice, both
times of which demonstrated the ETT lodged between tracheal wall
and stent. Pt's saturation improved with repositioning.
Respiratory status also complicated by possible underlying COPD
given smoking history with possible air stacking/trapping. Pt
was started on vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin (started
[**2172-8-31**] for 8 day course) for VAP. Vanco was later held as the
level was elevated in the setting of renal failure.  Patient's
family decided to persue comfort only care on [**2172-9-6**], and she
was terminally extubated.  Patient expired 15 minutes later from
respiratory failure and asystole secondary to lung cancer.
.
# Altered Mental Status: Pt had decline in mental status over
time. She initially withdrew from noxious stimuli but later was
less responsive. AMS continued despite sedation being off. AMS
most likely due to toxic metabolic syndrome in setting of uremia
and multi-system organ failure. Differential also included
seizure (given hx of cerebral aneurysm repair, on
anti-epileptics presumably prophylactically) although EEG did
not demonstrate focal abnormalities. LP did not demonstrate
infection or spread of malignancy. CT head [**2172-9-2**] negative for
acute process.
.
#. Small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor probably
fits into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. Given
associated SVC syndrome, prognosis poor. CT head/[**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis
negative for metastases.  Pt underwent 3 days of chemotherapy
and 2 sessions of XRT.  Initially, XRT was clinical emergency -
normal and pathologic tissue was likely treated; necrotic tissue
noted on bronchoscopy [**2172-9-4**]. Pt was to undergo formal tissue
planning session on [**2172-9-8**] to better delineate area of radiation
however family decided to persue comfort only care on [**2172-9-6**].
.
# Acute Renal failure: In setting of chemo with carboplatin.
Urine casts consistent with ATN. Uric acid and electrolytes
elevated 4-5d post chemotherapy concerning for tumor lysis
syndrome.  The next therapeutic step was dialysis as patient
became oliguric despite volume overload but the family wished
for comfort only care given dismal prognosis of her lung cancer.
.
#. Metabolic acidosis: Originally thought to be non-gap
metabolic acidosis due to hypoaldosteronism and type IV RTA.
With low albumin, however, this is a gap metabolic acidosis,
most likely due to uremia. Unable to increase RR to compensate
due to concern for auto-peeping in setting of possible COPD.
Goal pH is 7.3-7.35. On [**2172-9-5**], pt's acidosis worsened with pH
7.16-7.18. Despite adjusting ETT placement and decreasing RR to
reduce auto-peep, pt's acidosis worsened. Bicarbonate was given.

.
# Tachycardia/Hypotension ?????? Pt with tachycardia to 140s and
episodes of hypotension to SBP low 80s. Pt with new A-fib on
telemetry and EKG. DDx includes possible enlarging pericardial
effusion/tamponade but pulsus paradoxus was normal and ECHO
[**2172-9-5**] was unchanged from prior. No pneumothorax seen on CXR.
Unable to assess for PE by CTA as pt in renal failure and VQ
would not be helpful in setting of other lung pathology. LENI's
negative for DVT. PE likely given malignancy and prolonged bed
rest but unable to do CTA given renal failure and VQ scan not
helpful in setting of lung changes. Even if it had been
positive, heme/onc recommended against anti-coagulation in
setting of possible tumor necrosis/hemorrhage. Pt remained
tachycardic to 130s despite numerous fluid boluses.
.
#. Electrolyte disturbances: Pt developed hypernatremia on
[**2172-9-4**] most likley due to dehydration with free water deficit
of 1.4L, started on D5W. Pt had hyponatremia and hyperkalemia on
admission, both resolved. Unclear etiology of electrolyte
disturbances on admission- hyponatremia thought to be secondary
to possible adrenal insufficency (now discarded) or possibly
SIADH.  Low UNa does not exclude SIADH; renal recommended
rechecking urine lytes with saline load, whcih was not done in
setting of pt??????s other medical issues. Hyperkalemia originally
attributed to hypoaldosteronism and Type IV RTA, but unlikely
per endocrine because of low urine sodium.
.
#. SVC syndrome:  Incomplete occlusion of SVC; near complete
occlusion of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by
upper extremity and facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin.
Also with scleral edema. Unable to assess jugular venous
distension given considerable swelling. Seen in appoximately 10%
cases of SSLC. Improved edema on exam compared to admission. SVC
syndrome occurred after Y-stent placed. Possible that tumor
pushing into trachea shifted to compress SVC after stent
placement. She underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy for
decompression.
.
#. Pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement
[**2172-8-25**], removed [**2172-8-31**]. LDH effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate by
Light??????s criteria). Greatest concern for malignant effusion
however cytology was nonspecific.  Cultures of fluid all
preliminary negative.
.
#. Pneumothorax: Developed pneumothorax in setting of
re-intubation that resolved after chest tube placement.
.
#. Pericardial effusion:  Suspected by cardiology to be
malignant effusion. Felt not to be large enough for percutaneous
drainage. EKG without signs of electrical alternans but does
have low voltages. Repeat ECHO done [**2172-9-5**] in setting of
hypotension demonstrated no change in pericardial effusion.
.
# Sinus Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of sinus pauses on
tele night of [**8-30**] with turning to right side. Occurred again
[**2172-9-4**] again with re-positioning. Metoprolol was held and
glucagon given in case this was due to beta blocker toxicity,
but pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their own
without intervention. Cardiology consulted who felt it was
vagally mediated. [**Month (only) 116**] have been due to ETT tube displacement
pressing on carotid when pt was turned.
.
# Leukopenia/thrombocytopenia ?????? Most likely due to chemotherapy
and no improvement in counts on neupogen. She was repeatedly
pan-cultured with negative results.
.
#. Anemia:  Normocytic and likely due to anemia of chronic
disease given malignancy.  Hemolysis labs were negative.
.
# s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  History of cerebral aneurysm
repair with a number of chronic changes on head CT.  Her
antiepileptic medications were continued.
