Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**] MEDICINE
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56-year-old white
female with a history of right frontal craniotomy on [**2109-7-1**], for a dysembryoplastic angioneural epithelial lesion
with features of an oligodendroglioma who was started on
Dilantin postoperatively for seizure prophylaxis and was
subsequently developed eye discharge and was seen by an
optometrist who treated it with sulfate ophthalmic drops.
The patient then developed oral sores and rash in the chest
the night before admission which rapidly spread to the face,
trunk, and upper extremities within the last 24 hours.  The
patient was unable to eat secondary to mouth pain.  She had
fevers, weakness, and diarrhea.  There were no genital
the morning of [**7-20**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypercholesterolemia.  2.  Benign
right frontal cystic tumor status post right frontal
craniotomy on [**2109-7-1**].

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor, Tylenol with Codeine, Dilantin,
previously on Decadron q.i.d. tapered over one week and
discontinued a week ago.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband,
daughter, and son.  [**Name (NI) **] smoking or ethanol use history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  T-max 104.3??????, currently
100.8??????, heart rate 107-110, blood pressure 110/27,
respirations 15-20, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
General:  The patient was an alert, ill-appearing woman with
postsurgical occiput.  Head and neck:  Injected conjunctivae,
greenish ocular discharge, ulcerative oral lesions.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rhythm.  Rapid rate.  No murmurs.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:
Normoactive bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  No edema.  Skin:  Diffuse erythema and pustules
on the face.  Patulous pustules on the chest, back, and
proximal upper extremities.  GU:  No genital lesions.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 34.1, WBC 10.3, platelet count
291,000, differential of 87 neutrophils, 0 bands; sodium 133,
potassium 3.8, chloride 93, CO2 21, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9,
glucose 121; ALT 39, AST 42, LDH 434, amylase 63, albumin
3.4, total bilirubin 0.3; urinalysis with positive ketones,
negative nitrites; urine culture pending; blood cultures
times two pending; conjunctival culture pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's severe exfoliative skin
involvement with rapid progression and extensive involvement
of the body, she was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for close monitoring.  She was started on prophylactic
Oxacillin to cover skin flora, and Dermatology was consulted
along with Neurology and Ophthalmology for the ophthalmic
involvement.

The patient's course in the Intensive Care Unit was
uneventful, and she was discharged to the floor with very
close monitoring which included q.1 hour Pred Forte
application to the eye and close consultation with
Ophthalmology.  With regard to her skin lesions, they
continued exfoliate over the next couple of days, and her
skin care included frequent Vaseline hydrated petroleum
application to decrease insensible losses.  The patient's
intake and output were closely monitored and replaced
appropriately; however, the intensive nursing care
requirement made it difficult for the patient to receive
adequate on the floor, and therefore, she was transferred to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit again for frequent ophthalmic
applications and skin care.

While in the MICU, the patient continued to have meticulous
skin care and eye care.  The skin lesions continued to
desquamate and exfoliate which is the natural
progression of this disease.  She began to have involvement
of the genital area with continued desquamation of the
exfoliative lesions.  Her course in the Intensive Care Unit
within the next 8-10 days was a slow but gradual improvement
from a dermatologic and ophthalmologic standpoint.

From a cardiovascular standpoint, she was in sinus
tachycardia which was felt to be secondary to her
[**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome leading to dehydration and
insensible fluid losses.

While in the Intensive Care Unit, she was also found to be
mildly hypoxic which is likely secondary to atelectasis
because of the patient's immobility.  Lower extremity
Dopplers were also done, and no deep venous thromboses were
found.

From and Infectious Disease standpoint, the patient was
started on intravenous Oxacillin empirically.  Blood cultures
on the 5th was with no growth times two; however, one bottle
from her PICC line grew out gram-positive cocci on [**7-27**].
She was started on a course of Vancomycin.  Subsequently the
organism was found to be CNS with Corynebacterium, and
Vancomycin was discontinued prior to transfer to the floor on
[**8-5**].

The patient's course on the floor was uncomplicated with
continued improvement.

Dermatology:  The patient, as indicated, improved
dramatically from her presentation to the time of discharge.
Her exfoliative lesions healed over the course of this
admission.  Her skin care requirements decreased to Petroleum
jelly twice a day at the time of discharge.  She was able to
take in oral foot without problems.

Ophthalmology:  The patient's eye care requirement improved
markedly.  She was able to open her eyes and use her vision
without significant problems at the time of discharge.  Her
Pred Forte was discontinued on the day of discharge, and she
is to have follow-up with Ophthalmology a couple of days
after discharge.

Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition:  On admission the patient
was begun on TPN for nutritional support.  As the patient
improved from a medical perspective, her TPN was weaned, and
at the time of discharge, the patient was taking adequate
p.o. with supplementation of Boost.

Infectious Disease:  At the time of admission, she was
started on empiric antibiotics and placed on contact
precautions secondary to her extensive skin lesions; however,
as the patient improved throughout the course of this
admission, contact precautions were discontinued, and the
patient was discharged home with services.

Cardiology/Pulmonology:  The patient was tachycardiac
throughout this admission which was attributed to her fluid
losses secondary to [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome; however, given
the patient's immobility throughout the course of this
admission, a CT angiogram was performed to evaluate for
possible pulmonary embolism, and none were found.

Neurology:  The patient has a history of cystic tumor status
post resection in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year and was started on
prophylactic Dilantin leading to presumed [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **]
syndrome.  At the time of this admission, the patient's
Dilantin was discontinued, and no other anticonvulsants were
started, given the patient's risk of seizures several weeks
after her surgery was unlikely.  This decision was made with
the support of her neurosurgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1338**].

Five days before discharge, the patient did have a syncopal
event while in the bathroom showering with the help of a
nursing aide.  The likely etiology of this is orthostatic
hypotension from her fluid losses; however, given the
patient's neurologic history, Neurology was consulted to
evaluate for possible seizure.  Neurology's recommendations
were to obtain a repeat CT scan which was unchanged from
previous showing a right frontal lobe extra-axial hypodensity
which was stable.  They also recommended repeat MR imaging
which was again unremarkable except for a stable extra-axial
lesion noted on CT scan.  Neurology therefore agrees with the
primary team that the syncopal event was likely secondary to
a vasovagal reaction.  A follow-up MR scan would be
recommended with gadolinium to evaluate for the presence of
residual tumor.  This can be done as an outpatient with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1338**].

Rehabilitation:  The patient throughout this admission worked
with our physical therapy people and continued to improve
with regard to range of motion and strength in the upper and
lower extremities, and by the time of discharge, she was
ambulating throughout the [**Doctor Last Name **] and around the hospital
without problems.  She was therefore discharged home without
need for Physical Therapy Services.

At the time of discharge, the patient has markedly improved
from her initial presentation and is to be discharged home
with nursing assistance.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Markedly improved.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome secondary to Dilantin.
2.  Status post craniotomy on [**2109-7-1**], for a cystic
cranial lesion, likely dysembryoplastic angioneural
epithelial lesion with features consistent with an
oligodendroglioma.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Polysporin ophthalmology O.U. q.i.d.,
hydrated Petroleum as needed, Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.,
Nystatin, Boost t.i.d.

FOLLOW-UP:  1.  Ophthalmology [**2109-8-20**], at 12:45
p.m.  2.  Primary care physician in two weeks.  3.
Dermatology as needed.

DISCHARGE NOTE:  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PATIENT IS ALLERGIC TO
DILANTIN AND TEGRETOL GIVEN HER [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] SECONDARY TO
DILANTIN.  The patient is recommended to wear an alert
bracelet which indicates this reaction.
