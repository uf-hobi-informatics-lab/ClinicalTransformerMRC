HPI: 79 yo F with MDS--> AML, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
diverticulosis, h/o anal fissure, AVM s/p recent cauterization
who was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 93626**] for decitabine and was
in outpatient center today for platelet transfusion for dropping
plt count (22) and nosebleeds. She tolerated the infusion but on
her way home, she developed rigors, chills and she returned to
the outpatient unit. Upon arrival, she was hypertensive and had
a temp to 99.8. She was given benadryl, demerol, tylenol,
hydrocortisone. She subsequently became hypotensive to 90/40 and
received IVF bolus. She had intermittent, mild hypoxia 93-96%.
  She was thought to have a transfusion reaction (work-up
ordered) but her labs were notable for neutropenia and she was
referred to the ED for admission.

In ER: (Triage Vitals: 99.1 85 118/50 18 93% RA) CBC notable for
hct 19.6 from 24.9 earlier in the day. hemolysis labs negative.
CXR revealed mild interstitial edema. CT scan was performed to
r/o a RP bleed.

Currently, she feels completely well. She reports that she felt
while prior to the platelet infusion and denies any fever,
chills, abd pain, N/V/D, cough, headache. Her only concern is a
bruise/canker sore in her L mouth which is mildly tender.

Microbiology:
=============
Urine culture: mixed flora
Blood culture: no growth
MRSA screen: negative
.
Imaging:
========
[**4-1**] CHEST (PA & LAT) - Calcified pleural plaque is better
assessed on the prior CT. There is mild interstitial edema with
no large effusions or pneumothorax. No signs of pneumonia.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Calcified
tracheobronchial tree noted. Bony structures are intact
.
[**4-1**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO - No acute intra-abdominal or
pelvic process. No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Stable gallbladder polyp. Stable gallbladder polyps versus a
focus of adenomyomatosis within the gallbladder fundus. Sigmoid
diverticulosis. Patchy bibasilar opacities within the lung
bases, with subpleural scar formations and bronchiectasis within
the lung bases.
.
[**2195-4-8**] CT head without contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Slightly
dense appearance of the cortex lateral to the Sylvian fissure (
se 2, im 12) is likely related to volume averaging rather than
hemorrhage; a follow up can be considered if necessary. No prior
CT studies are available.
2. Bilateral mastoid opacification from fluid/mucosal thickening

.
CTA [**2195-4-18**] Abd-Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. No contrast extravasation to suggest GI bleeding.
2. Stable gallbladder polyp and fundal adenomyomatosis.
3. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
4. Small left adrenal adenoma.
5. Unchanged Focal celiac artery and aortic dilation as
described above.
.
Colonoscopy:
============
[**3-1**] Colonoscopy prior to this admission:
Abnormal mucosa in the colon. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid
colon. A small posterior rectal fissure was noted in the anal
canal. This was not bleeding. Blood was noted throughout the
entire colon.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
.
[**2195-4-3**] colonoscopy:
Non bleediong diverticulosis of the whole colon. Bleeding
angioectasias in the cecum treated with APC. Polyp in the
transverse colon. Blood and stool throughout colon. Non bleeding
posterior anal fissure.
.
[**2195-4-13**] colonoscopy:
Blood in the whole colon. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
and descending colon. Ulcers in the cecum. A large adherent
blood clot was found in the cecum with surrounding oozing of
bright red blood. Given the risk of uncontrollable bleeding in
the setting of low platelets, the clot was not removed.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 73078**] is 79 year old pleasant woman with a Past medical
history significant for MDS with AML transformation on Dacogen,
diverticulosis, known cecal AVMs admitted from clinic on [**2195-4-1**]
in the setting of a transfusion reaction to platelets with
thrombocytopenia who was noted to develop bright red blood per
rectum with acute hematocrit drop who underwent repeat
colonoscopy showing non-bleeding diverticulosis of the entire
colon and bleeding angioectasias of the cecum treated with Argon
Plasma coagulation. She required a second colonoscopy for
repeated bloody bowel movements which showed a clot adherent to
the cecum. She remained stable for a while then had frequent
bloody bowel movements again which was controlled by amicar drip
for 8 hours. Gradually her platelets started to increase. After
these events, she remained stable and was discharged home in
stable condition. She will require HLA matched platelet
transfusions in the future if needed.
.
# cecal AVMs:  She was transferred to the ICU twice for bright
red blood per rectum. The patient developed BRBPR, and was found
to have cecal AVMs on colonoscopy s/p APC. Specifically, repeat
colonoscopy demonstrated cecal angioectasias that were actively
bleeding, non-bleeding colonic diverticula and small polyp.
Hemostasis achieved with Argon Plasma coagulation therapy on
[**2195-4-3**].  During her stay she required several units of PRBC and
platelets. After remaining stable, she was transferred back to
the floor however she had the same situation again and was
transferred back to the ICU where she had her second colonoscopy
which showed a clot adherent to the cecum with oozing around the
clot. The clot was not removed (not amenable to endoscopic
management). GI recommended surgical consult for possible
resection however given her underlying disease and low platelet
counts, they felt this will not be a favorable management. After
having stable H/H, she was transferred back to the floor. While
on the floor, she had a few bloody bowel movements however the
night of [**4-17**] she had total of 450 cc bloody watery stools which
required amicar drip for 8 hours (her platelets were in the
40-50's). CTA was negative. Following this, she did not have any
further significant bloody stools. She remained vitally stable
with stable H/H and gradually rising platelet count.
.
# thrombocytopenia: Secondary to chemotherapy and MDS/AML
concerns. Concern for consumptive process following transfusion
of platelets in the setting of possible ITP vs. TTP however
Hematologic smear was without schistocytes and there was no
evidence of renal failure or neurologic concerns; no fevers. The
patient also had two transfusion reactions to platelets when
first admitted. She was premedicated with anti-histamines. While
the patient was actively bleeding, she was also given Amicar (2
grams IV with 1gram/hour IV infusion overnight on [**2195-4-2**]). This
was repeated over the night of [**4-17**] as above. She was found to
have a positive PRA and required HLA matched platelets for all
subsequent transfusions. Her twin sister was tested at Red Cross
for potential candidate to donate platelets for her sister
however since she takes aspirin and plavix, this was not a
suitable option. Of note, her platelet count was improving
already and did not require further platelet transfusions.
Platelet count was in the 90's upon discharge.
.
# transfusion reaction/PRA positive: The patient had transfusion
reaction to platelet transfusion (once in clinic, and once while
on the floor). She was premedicated with famotidine, benadryl,
and hydrocortisone. A blood bank work up was initiated, and the
patient was given group specific platelets. She was found to be
PRA positive and requires HLA matched platelets. However, during
her second episode of BRBPR on [**4-12**], it was found that there was
no more HLA matched platelets available in [**Location (un) 86**] area. Red
Cross was contact[**Name (NI) **] for more HLA matched platelets. Sister was a
potential donor however it wasn't suitable given her
anti-platelet therapy as above. She did not require further
platelet transfusions once her platelet count started to
increase.
.
# MDS with AML transformation:  While the patient was on the
floor, it was noticed that her blast count was trending up and
her neutrophil count was trending down.  It was then decided to
start her on second cycle of Dacogen (day 1 = [**2195-4-8**]).  The
patient tolerated the Dacogen well, with little side effects.
12% blast cells on peripheral blood upon discharge.
.
# GERD: The patient was continued on her home PPI.
.
# constipation:  The patient has a history of severe
constipation, however, her home medications were held in the
setting of her BRBPR and then restarted upon discharge given
resolution of bloody bowel movements.
.
Transitional Issues:
- The patient had transfusion reaction to platelets; a blood
bank work up was initiated and she was found to be PRA positive;
she will require HLA matched platelets for all subsequent
transfusions.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 73078**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were hospitalized
at [**Hospital1 18**].  You were admitted to the hospital because you had a
transfusion reaction after getting platelets at clinic.  We did
some tests and found that you will need specially screened
platelets from now on because your body reacts to normal
platelets.

While you were here, you also developed some bleeding from your
rectum.  You were transferred to the intensive care unit and
they gastrointestinal doctors looked into your intestines with a
camera and found some areas of bleeding called AV malformations
that were clipped. After this, you were sent to the floor then
sent back to the ICU when you had further bleeding. Second
colonoscopy was done which showed a large clot attached to your
colon in the same area where the AVM's were clipped. Your blood
level was stable as well as your blood pressure and you were
transferred to the floor.

While on the floor, you had a few loose bloody stools that
subsequently resolved. Your diet was gradually advanced and you
tolerated it well prior to discharge. Your platelets gradually
increased and it was in the 80's on your discharge day.

The surgeons evaluated you for possible surgical removal of part
of your colon, however they felt it is unsafe to do surgery for
the moment. We did not discharge you on Amicar which is a clot
stabilizer medication since you did not have further bloody
stools, your blood level was stable and your platelets were
gradually increasing.

We also noticed some changes in your blood work that made us
think that your leukemia was acting up again; because of that we
started you on another five day cycle of chemotherapy.  You
tolerated the chemo well.
.
While in the hosiptal, it was noted that occasionally your blood
pressure was high and you were started on a medication for brief
time. However, given your GI bleeds, this was held. We will not
discharge you at the moment with anti-hypertensive medication.

We did the following changes in your medication list:
- Please stop allopurinol

Please continue the rest of your home medications the same way
you were taking them at home prior to admission.

Your PICC line was removed prior to discharge.

It will be important for you to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Please follow with your appointments as illustrated below.
