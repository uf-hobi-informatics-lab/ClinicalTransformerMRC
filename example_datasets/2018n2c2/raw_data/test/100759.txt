Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
Post-operative hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Debridement of tracheal nodule with interventional pulmonology


History of Present Illness:
72 yo F with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of
the lung who underwent rigid bronch [**2154-8-30**] (Friday) in the
CDC for debridement of a nodule partially occluding the trachea
(CT 09/[**2153**]).

Patient was apneic post-operatively attributed to paralytics,
for which she was intubated and placed on AC until the paralytic
wore off. She was then weaned to CPAP and extubated to high flow
facemask without difficulty. She was later switched to high flow
face tent and then nasal canula 4L->2L and was comfortable
sating 92%.

On the floor, the patient was comfortable on 2L nasal cannula,
sating 94%. Complains of coughing when taking deep breaths, but
otherwise stable. She denies CP, N/V/D/C, dysuria, HA, vision
changes, or depressed mood.

[**2154-8-31**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Right upper, right perihilar, right lower lobe opacities
consistent with
improving hemorrhage or aspiration are unchanged. A left lung is
grossly
clear. There is no evident pneumothorax. Right lung peripheral
opacities
better evaluated in prior CT [**8-5**] and are unchanged.

[**2154-8-31**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
There has been markedly improved in right upper, right perihilar
and right
lower lobe opacities consistent with improving hemorrhage or
aspiration.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly.
There is no evident pneumothorax. Of note, the lateral aspect of
the left
hemithorax was not included on the film. There are no increasing
right
pleural effusions. Sternal wires are aligned with fracture of
the first wire.

[**2154-8-30**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the
endotracheal tube has been removed. The diffuse area of
opacification involving the perihilar region extending into both
the apical and lower zone on the right is again seen. Again,
this could well represent post-procedure hemorrhage, though
supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.

[**2154-8-30**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSIONS: Extensive right central and upper lung airspace
opacity, which may reflect hemorrhage from the recent procedure,
or asymmetric pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Apnea/Hypoxia: The patient experienced apnea in the immediate
post-operative period following debridement of a tracheal
nodule. The apnea was thought to be attributed to paralytics,
which warranted intubation. When the paralytic agents wore off,
the patient was extubated, but remained hypoxia. The prolonged
hypoxia post-operatively was attributed to aspiration
pneumonitis likely with an element of post-operative
inflammation from the procedure itself. The patient remained
rhoncorous with course upper airway breath sounds throughout the
hospitalization. CXR ruled out PNA as a potentialy source of
hypoxia, and the patient did not produce significant volumes of
concentration of blood in the sputum concerning for tracheal
bleed. Other possibilities include worsening of underlying lung
cancer which is unlikely to explain acute hypoxia. The patient
was eventually transitioned to high flow face mask, followed by
high-flow face tent, followed by nasal cannular on 4L. The
patient was weaned without event from 4L to 2L nasal cannula and
transferred to the inpatient medical floor, where she continued
sat'ing ~94% on 2L. Nebs were administered on an as needed basis
throughout the duration of hospitalization, and were found to be
helpful in terms of coughing up phlegm.

The patient was taken off supplemental oxygen the following day
and sat'ed within her normal baseline range 88-92% on room air
without any problems at rest. However, patient desaturated with
physical therapy during activity. They recommended home oxygen
(2L with activity)when ambulating with a walker. The patient
will be discharged with home oxygen as well as VNA services.
.
# Hct Drop: The patient presented with a Hct 44.7 and found to
have a Hct of 33.1 post-operatively. The low Hct is most likely
attributable to fluids received during procedure and minimal
blood loss, however given the 12 point drop, her lab values were
followed and the Hct level was stable and began to rise without
event or concern for chonic blood loss. Hct 34.0->35.8 this AM.
.
# Non-Small Cell Lung CA: A new tracheal mass identified on CT
in [**Month (only) **] was highly concerning for metastasis and likely to
grow to occlude airway the airway, so surgical debridement was
warranted with interventional pulmonology without intraoperative
complications outside of apnea/hypoxia as elaborated on above.
The patient is now POD#2 s/p debridment by IP. Biopsy results
are pending. She is followed by interventional pulmonology for
continued management.
.
# Goals of Care: Discussed code status with patient, daughter
and sons. [**Name (NI) **] quite clearly does not desire intubation or
heroic measures. Daughter is having a difficult time with this
but understands and respects her mother's wishes. The DNR/DNI
status was confirmed with the patient and her health care proxy.

.
# IDDM: Continued home glargine and home meds.

# HTN: Continued amlodipine, lopressor and ASA.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home statin.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the [**Hospital 18**] hospital for surgical debridement
of a tracheal nodule that was contributing to your difficulty
breathing. You underwent this procedure with the interventional
pulmonologists.

After surgery you were found to have difficulty breathing and
decreased oxygen levels that were thought to be a result of both
the paralytic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] used during surgery as well as the
possibility that you aspirated fluids into your trachea/lungs
during surgery. As such, you were intubated and transferred to
the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory care and
support.

In the MICU, your blood oxygen levels improved over the course
of a day on supplemental oxygen and you were transitioned from a
face-mask to a face-tent to a nasal cannula on supplementary
oxygen. When your oxygen levels stabilized, you were transferred
to the inpatient floor, where you were eventually weaned off of
supplementary oxygen. You were breathing stable at your baseline
blood oxygen levels on the inpatient floor at rest, but were
found to be significantly short of breath with activity. As
such, physical therapy has recommended home oxygen, as well as
instructed you to walk with a walker.

We have set up visiting nursing to assist you with your home
oxygen, as well as evaluating you for home safety and continued
physical therapy.

The following changes were made to your at-home medications:
1) Added Home oxygen.
2) Added Albuterol-Ipratropium inhaler. Please take 1-2 PUFFs
every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
No other changes were made to your at-home medications. Please
continue taking them as instructed.
3) Decreased your metoprolol to 50 mg twice a day from 150 mg

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your primary care physician 7-10 days
following discharge.
